In a few moments Denver City Council will be called to order, the weekly meeting begins with the delivery of formal communications followed by individual proclamations brought forward by council members. The first portion of the meeting concludes with the reading of new legislation. After a brief recess, Council will consider bills for final passage, including public hearings on a variety of zoning and other matters. Denverate's coverage begins with these agenda highlights. We'll begin a look at this Monday, May 11, turning directly to a resolution 264, which sets a public hearing on June 1, for the Rhino Business Improvement District. Underbills for introduction, Council Bill 257 amends the agreement for the design and construction of the light rail station located at 61st and Peña Boulevard. Council Bill 258 approves a 40-year development agreement for the construction of phase 1 improvements at the Peña station area. Council Bill 256 approves the intergovernmental agreement with the City of Englewood to provide fire protection services. And Council Bill 268 revises the Denver Municipal Code regarding tobacco products. Now let's look at bills for final consideration. There are no public hearings on this agenda. Other bills of note include Council Bill 239, which is a lease purchase agreement, to finance the 911 Communications Center. And Council Bill 176, which adds $200,000 for additional design services at the Central Denver Recreation Center. And that's a quick look at this Monday, May 11, meeting with Denver City Council, meeting as chaired by Council President Chris Herndon, and will begin in a moment. Ladies and gentlemen, we are up in the green light as on, so we will go ahead and begin. On the second Monday of most months, the Denver City Council celebrates an aid in the implementation of Imagine 2020, Denver's cultural plan, by featuring a poet, musician, or performer at the beginning of council meetings. Built on seven vision elements, Imagine 2020 sets forward several strategic goals, including integrating the arts into daily life, making the arts more accessible, and ensuring that Denver creators can thrive. We encourage all of Denver to do as part to implement Imagine 2020. Please visit www.imaginedember2020.org for more information.

Thank you Madam Secretary. All right council members this is your last opportunity to call out any bills or resolutions starting at the top we have no resolutions called out bills for introduction no bills for introduction called out bills for final councilwoman thoughts 239 and under pending no bills called out so we've got one 239 ma'am secretary would you like to tee that up for us please and while that's about to happen councilwoman thoughts what would you like for us to do with this please put it on the floor for a vote certainly can Councilman Brooke can you make the motion for us tonight well why certainly could you please have 239 place on final consideration and do pass thanks Mr. President I put council bill 239 on the floor for final consideration and do pass it's been moved we need a second it's been moved and seconded comments councilwoman thoughts thank you mr. President this is the ordinance that issues allows the issuance of certificates of participation

to purchase a couple buildings essentially and we are pledging for other city buildings to raise this financing a library and three firehouses talk last time we have length about this I will just say I am not a supporter of certificates of participation I believe it is a form of debt that goes behind the voters backs and allows public officials to raise money that was not intended to be behind the scenes if we're going to incur long-term obligations I think people always intended to have that go to them as a vote this does not do that and therefore I am not willing to give permission for 24 million dollars worth of certificates of participation plus interest which may go up to just shy of 10 million additional thank you councilman thoughts councilman Lopez thank you mr. President I just want to disrespect I just want to sorry respectfully disagree what would the opposite of that be disrespectfully agree respectfully agree respectfully disagree with my it was a long week last week come on give it a break with my colleague councilwoman Fox I think I think her reasons solid except when you look at the what the facilities are for what it is for and its fire station and library facilities I think the intent there is to make sure that we do have adequate fire protection we do have library services these are values that we have as citizens and if you know when somebody shows up to your door and an emergency and it's a firefighter or they're coming to perform their fire duties the first thing we don't ask is how was your fire station built the fact that it's built and the services are out so I do respect reasoning but I just disagree thank you thank you supporting the councilman Lopez councilman Fauci back up thank you mr. President I just want to clarify we are pledging the fire stations we're like we're mortgaging them and we are mortgaging the library for something else so if worse came to worse and we didn't pay the obligation they would come take the firehouses and they come take the library so I don't quite follow that argument thank you councilman Fauci any other comments 239 seeing none ma'am secretary roll call Fauci no each layman aye Lopez aye Monteiro aye Nevett aye Ortega Rob aye Shepherd aye Sussman aye Brooks aye Brown aye mr.

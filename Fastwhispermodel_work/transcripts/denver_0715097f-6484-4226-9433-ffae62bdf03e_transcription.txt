I want to welcome everyone to the Denver City Council meeting of Tuesday, March 27th, 2018. Please rise and join Councilwoman Artego with the Pledge of Allegiance. All right, Madam Secretary, roll call. Black. Here. Clark. Here. Espinosa. Here. Gilmore. Herndon. Cashman. Here. Can each. Here. Lopez. Here. New. Here. Ortega. Here. Here. Ms. President. Here. 11, President. 11 members present. We do have a quorum. Approval of the minutes. Are there any corrections to the minutes of March 19th? Seeing none, the minutes of March 19th stand approved. Council announcements. Any members have announcements? Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. Two quick things. I am not calling out a bill that's on final consideration, but I do want to thank Public Works for helping to make some arrangements to get some much needed eight foot wide sidewalks installed around the Yale station. It will be really important to getting people to be able to walk to the light rail, and I wanted to thank them for doing that. I also wanted to let people know in my district on Tuesday, April 3rd, which is a week from tonight. We'll be having our Southmore visioning follow-up meeting. It starts at 5.30 with pizza, and then meeting kicks off at 6. Thanks. Great. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Dr. Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. Just wanted to let folks know that the Mayfair neighborhood is holding its annual Easter egg hunt this Sunday at 10 o'clock. Ending at 10.06, because that's about how long it takes for all the children to find all the eggs in the whole park. But welcome to all to come out and enjoy this very fun activity. This Sunday at 10 o'clock at Mayfair Park. All right. Any other announcements by members of Council? Okay, seeing none, none. All right. Wait a second. Okay. I'll make that announcement later. Presentations. We have no presentations, communications with no communications, but we do have one proclamation. Councilwoman Sussman, Dr. Sussman, please read Proclamation 3.13. Thank you, Mr. President. In honor of women's history month, I am very proud to be bringing forth this proclamation. Honoring Denver's Women First Responders. Whereas Women's History Month designation traces back to the first International Women's Day in 1911. In February 1980, President Jimmy Carter made a presidential proclamation declaring the week of March 8th National Women's History Week, stating that too often women's contributions to American society were unsung and unnoticed. And whereas the City and County of Denver has a rich history of women serving as members of the Denver Police Department, the Denver Sheriff's Department, and the Denver Fire Department. And whereas the women of the Denver Police Department contract their history back to the 1880s with police matrons Sadie Likens, who oversaw female and juvenile prisoners in the city jail. Margaret Conway led efforts to prevent human trafficking in the 1920s. Josephine Roche started her public service career in 1912 as a Denver Police Officer, Grand for Governor, and went on to serve as Assistant Secretary to the Treasury under Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Women officers finally joined their male counterparts in patrolling the streets of Denver in the 1970s. And whereas the women of the Denver Sheriff's Department contract their history to Aurora Quinn, who has appointed a Denver Deputy Sheriff and served from 1902 to 1922. Quinn was the first female probation officer in the state of Colorado, as well as one of the earliest female Deputy Sheriffs in the United States. The celebrated Ida Younger started her career as a uniformed Denver Deputy in 1958. In 2007, Marie Kyler became the first female Division Chief overseeing the Downtown Detention Center and Support Services. And whereas the women of the Denver Fire Department contract their history to the Early Women's Fire Auxiliary, Heather Larson joined the department as the first active female firefighter in 1985. In 2009, Angela Cook became the first woman Division Chief overseeing operations at DIA. Early this year, Twania Clark became the first African American female engineer in the 150-year history of the department. Most recently, on March 7th, newly appointed Assistant Chief Carly Helwick was the first chief to respond to the three alarm blaze at 1833 Emerson, directing the efforts of the firefighters battling that tragic blaze. And whereas the women first responders of Denver have served, protected, and saved countless lives in the city and county of Denver, while showing leadership, courage, and strength in the line of duty, they are our trailblazers and our role models. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the council, the city and county of Denver, that the council hereby recognizes and thanks the hundreds of women who have served our community as members of the Denver Police Department, the Denver Sheriff Department, and the Denver Fire

Department. And section two, that the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be delivered to the Denver Police Department, the Denver Sheriff Department, and the Denver Fire Department. Your motion to adopt? I move that we adopt this proclamation. All right. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of council, Dr. Sussman. Well, I can't tell you how proud I am to have all these wonderful women in the audience and to be asked to give such a proclamation. It has been a wonderful experience just learning the history of the Denver Fire Department, the Police Department, and the Sheriff Department. And of the number of women who did things long ago and those who have done them most recently to help protect our city, to help protect our citizens and everything that you have done in your lives to serve the community, to serve all of us. I was able to talk just a little bit with some of you beforehand and it's just inspiring to have you here. I urge my fellow colleagues to please vote for this proclamation for the proudness we feel for the women of these departments. Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to thank you all for your service and your leadership and for being role models for all of the women and girls. And please add my name as a sponsor. Thank you. We will add it. Councilwoman Artega. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to add my two cents on this proclamation as well. I can remember, I'm not sure if it was when I was serving as a staff member or after I had gotten elected as a council member. I think it was when I first got elected that I decided to audit the process by doing the application with the fire department. And this was, gosh, quite a few years ago, and folks in the city were asking if I was stepping down from serving in office or if I was trying to be on the fire department, I said, no, I'm just trying to audit the process because we don't have very many women who have gotten on the department. And I want to understand what the challenge and what the problem is. So needless to say, I didn't go through the whole process, but it was an interesting endeavor. And to see that we have so many more women in all three units, the sheriff's department, the police department and the fire department. And see you all sitting in the audience here tonight. I know you're not representative of all the women in those three units, but I want to thank you all for your service. My daughter is among our women in uniform that serve within our department and very proud of the work that she and each one of you do every day in representing our city and doing the best job that you can. And I just want to say I'm proud of each one of you for the work that you do for our city. You know, people get to see you as you're out in the public and you're a reflection of all of us. And I know that we have the utmost dedication and professionalism among folks in our department. And just want to say thank you for the work you do every day and day out. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Artega. Councilor Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman for bringing the proclamation forward. Thank you all for your service, and I just wanted to express my gratitude. You know, I think we don't know. I mean, occasionally you'll get one of the council members to do a ride along or come to roll call or anything like that, but really to really know the work that you all put in is hard work. Especially when you're in service and you have a badge like you do, either on your shoulder or above your heart. That city seal means something. That's all of us, right? And when I see this room, I see officers, I see deputies, I see firefighters, I see civil servants. Who happen to be women? But you all represent the everything that I try to teach my daughter to see, right? And I've always believed, and I think I'm not the only person that said this before, but you can't be what you can't see. And there's something to be said about you all being seen. I see you in the community, our kids see you in the community,

our community members see you in the community. And, you know, I got to say this, Councilman Artega is being very humble. Her own daughter is a deputy. And to see, and I passed Councilman Artega a picture that I took, because I caught it, she was getting a commendation in front of the City Council. And to see the eyes at Councilman Artega, just that pride. When she looked upon her daughter getting that commendation, that picture, I took that picture as soon as I could. I was like a teenage boy with people with camera, right? And it's the same look that I see in our community when they see you all, right? In this courthouse, in the fire station, or on patrol. And I just wanted to express that to you. I've never been able to say that to the group, but there it is. In ten years, I wanted to express that gratitude. I see that. So, thank you. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I too want to thank Councilwoman Sussman for bringing this up for recognition. The one problem that I sort of had in listening to that proclamation was the gap between beginning of service and leadership by females. And so, I think that that's amazing to me because if I think back to just my entire life, especially, you know, when I grew up, my first responders were always females. My grandmother and my mom. And there was no ageism. There was no concern about gender. That's the person I wanted there first, when I hurt myself, when I felt scared, when I needed that sense of security. And always exceeded expectations. And so, without, so I just want to say that gap, I'm glad to see we're making inroads, but it still can't happen soon enough because we're millennial behind in this. So, I just want to thank you all for your personal perseverance and the perseverance that you represent over time. And so, thank you all for your commitment to the city. Both past and present. Really appreciate you all for being here tonight. Thanks. All right, Councilwoman Kanique. Thank you, Mr. President. I won't echo this at well. I echo the appreciation shared by my colleagues, but I thought it would be nice to just comment a little bit on why I think your participation in our departments is so important. You've had to overcome many stereotypes, I think, about women. And I remember learning about the first female police officers and them having to conduct business in high heels, for example, because the uniform required a skirt in high heels. And so, we, in these agencies, so often focus on strength, right? It's about a gun, it's about a piece of equipment, whether it be firefighting equipment or driving a truck. And I think because of the protector image being such a physical one, you know, that was one of the major stereotypes. One of the major stereotypes that women had to overcome, and I know in all of your academies, you all have to meet these rigorous standards. And we know that women can meet men as equals in terms of physical abilities. But the research shows that women bring different problem solving skills to the job. And I think modern law enforcement and fire protection are so much more aware of that. And for example, our police department, you know, we think about training our police so much more in problem solving and de-escalation, which involves listening. And it involves the kind of empathy that, you know, someone who's in crisis might be able to hear. And I, you know, we don't want to reinforce stereotypes. It's not that all women are good at that, all men are bad. But the research demonstrates that when you bring women into a workplace, some of those types of skills are strengthened in the team. You know, I think about the firefighting team and, you know, anyone who's ever kind of watched those four person teams and how they have to operate, having women and team work, right, in terms of communication can subtly change the workplace in ways that help keep us all safer. And I think that is one of the things I most appreciate and why I think we need to continue to strive to bring more women into our safety departments because those skills aren't, it's not just that women are doing as good or the same job. It's that they bring perhaps subtle enhancements to these agencies, whether it be police or sheriff or fire, that are really important to us. And so that research, I think, is really clear. And so I appreciate not just the ways that you compete in the

same realm that you do with some of your male colleagues to get into these very competitive positions, but also the unique skills that many of you probably bring to the teams you're a part of. So thank you very much. And let's keep recruiting a more next generation. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Kenich. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. And my thanks to Councilwoman Sussman for bringing this forward. Thanks to you all for your service and thanks as well to the woman first responders who are not able to be here tonight that I know that you represent. But mainly, I wanted to thank you. I have two daughters. I have a 13-year-old granddaughter. And thank you so much for the role model that you offer up for them. It means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to them. And the last thing I wanted to do was give a personal shout out to Commander Megan Dodge who watches over our police district three so well and sorry to not see her out in the audience this evening. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. First, I would like the Secretary to have my name as a sponsor. I missed the jump in late last week and I apologize. I have always considered public safety, providing our residents with safety in their home and their workplace and out and about the city to be the primary role of local government. Because if we can't keep you safe at home, safe at work, safe while you're out and about, very little else would matter. And so I want to thank the women through the years, but particularly the women who are present here today for answering that call to provide the highest level of service that city government can provide to its citizens. Thank you very much. That's all, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Okay. We have Councilman Newell. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm so glad to see Connie Cole sitting out here because I can think back when I first came into office a couple of years ago. We were touring around to visit the various departments and agencies. And so we went out to the Smith Road Jail and there was Connie. They were giving us a tour around. I was so impressed with what she was doing and also what seemed so obvious to me the respect that she had from all the other officers there. And I'm so glad that she had not only managed that facility so well now, she's been promoted to help manage all the jails. We appreciate that. So thank you all for being here. What you're doing, the service you're providing is just incredible to the citizens of our city. You know, public safety is the number one priority for our city and our charter. And you play such an important part of that. And so you can't imagine you just can't see the respect and admiration that our citizens have for your role and what you're doing in terms of keeping them safe. So thank you for being here tonight. Thanks. Thank you, Councilman Newell. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to echo what my colleagues have set up here and I want to just say thank you for your service. Thank you for everything that you do. Thank you for the leadership that you provide in our city and the role models that you are for all of us. And thank you for being here. It's great to be a part of this tonight and happy to support this proclamation. Thank you for bringing it forward, Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Clark. Sorry, I forgot to mention this earlier. I want to remind us all that this Thursday there is an event at the PPA event center for women in law enforcement. I actually showed up last week thinking somehow it ended up on my calendar for last week and I thought I was early and come to find out it's this week, but I will be there on Thursday night. So hopefully you can all join me there as well. Thank you. Great. All right. I just want to tell all of you never, well, I don't say never, but rarely do we have all 13 Council members. Actually, we have 11 tonight. Speak in such high esteem. And so that's for you all. And I hope that you all really see that your city council supports you. And there's two other people that support you and they're my little girls. Kenya is eight and Kaya is six and they want to

do what dad does in the city. And they're asking about different jobs in the city. So I told them what they can be. And I told them about being a police officer or a firefighter and they're like, girls can't be that. They really said that. And I was like, oh, oh no. We have to sit with some ladies who not only are doing it, but doing it well. And that's you all. And so I just want to thank you. You know, you heard from city council on both grassroots to grass tops. How important your role is in this city. But you really have to understand you're making a difference in the model that you were setting for the city of Denver. So happy to support this, Dr. Sussman. We're behind you. Thank you. I think we're going to get unanimous support. I don't know though. We'll see. Madam Secretary roll call. Sussman. Hi. Black. Aye. Espinosa. Aye. Flynn. Aye. Cassian. Aye. Knit. Lopez. Aye. New. Ortega. Aye. Ms. President. Aye. The police are voting announcements results. Missing one. Missing one. Someone's hanging fire. All right. We got it. 11 ayes. 11 ayes. Unanimous. This is just crazy. I don't know how this happens. I'd like to invite retired police officer, Margaret Chavez, engineer Paulette Diaz of the Denver Fire Department, and Sheriff Deputy Major Jody Blair to the podium. And they were all very shy about doing this. So Margaret was the one that stepped up and said, although they fell each day a little bit. So welcome. Good evening and thank you for all your kind words. This means so much to me. My name is Margaret Chavez, and I'm a retired sergeant with the Denver Police Department. I was hired in 1985, and I retired in 2005 with 20 years of service. And I have to say that I am so proud and honored to have been a police officer for the City and County of Denver. I'm here to represent all of the women past and present of the Denver Police Department, and also as a representative of the Denver Police Museum, which was instrumental in preparing the plans for our dinner next Thursday. I am honored to accept this proclamation, recognizing the service of Denver Police women, starting back in 1888 through the present day. And I want to thank each and every one of the City Council members for this proclamation, recognizing the women's contribution through the years. Especially I would like to recognize two women that are no longer with us. In 1981, Denver lost the first police woman. Kathleen Garcia was killed on March 28, 1981. We have a picture of her. And actually it will be 37 years tomorrow. The last officer to die in the line of duty was Selena Hollis. Selena was killed June 24, 2012. I would like to introduce the officers that are present here today. So if you will stand when I call your name, Theresa Gillian from District 6, Patty Jung retired as an FTO, field training officer, who is next, Mona DeSanti, Mona retired as a detective, Jill Ricker, Jill retired from the Colorado State Patrol as an investigator, Jennifer Rowe, Jennifer retired as a patrol officer, and Barb Cisneros, Barb retired as a patrol officer. Thank you again so much. This means so much to all of us. Thank you. And next. Oh my gosh. I want her to speak for me. My name is Paulette Diaz, and I just want to say that the women who are representing you here tonight are the best of the best. Okay, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. We wear a card. We mentor each other. We do. We push each other. And we want to just thank you for recognizing us, the women who came before us and forged ahead, you know, Heather Larson, we're so thankful for, I'm glad I got the opportunity to work with Heather. I got the opportunity to work with Angela Cook and Carly Helwick who had that great fire the other day. So we're appreciative, we're honored, and we really love this job, and we love working for the citizens of Denver. You're lucky to have us. And we're moms, we're grandmothers, and we're willing to work hard, and these young women are ready to take over for us when I retire. Thank you. Wow. Wow, what they said. I'm Jody Blair. I am in my 27th year with the Denver Sheriff's Department, and I can honestly say it's been an amazing journey, and we have moved from matrons to deputies, not only myself, but those who are here with me today. So on behalf of all of the women of

the Denver Sheriff's Department, we thank you for this honor, and I appreciate as they do all of the kind sentiments and words that you gave us tonight. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry, I'd like to introduce Maryam Reed. I didn't know that she was here, she snuck in. She retired as the captain from the Denver Police Department, and he was the first woman division chief. Wow. Wow. Great. Thank you. And I have to say, I really appreciate the comment about hiring more women, because we've been at 11% women on the Denver Police Department for, I don't know, at least 20 years. And if you do a little demographic research, you'll find that really the population is about 51 or 2% women. So we're way behind in the women that we hire. And if you check with the city attorney, the lawsuits and settlements that get paid out on behalf of women or in the pennies. And on behalf of some of the men, it's in the thousands and millions. So we are an economic investment in many ways. Thank you so much for your support. Thank you. Thank you. You guys are welcome back anytime. You don't have to come just when there's a proclamation, so thank you for being here. We're excited. All right. We're going right in. And thank you, Dr. Sussman, again. We're going right into resolutions, Madam Secretary, will you please read the resolutions?

All right, Council members, it's your last opportunity to call out an item. Council Member Artego, will you please make that motion this evening? Be happy to. I'll do a quick recap. Under resolutions, we have nothing caught out. Under bills for introductions, we have nothing caught out and under final consideration, we have nothing caught out. However, Council Member Artego, you wanted to call out an item for a comment. That's 270. Let's bring up 270. Madam Secretary for a comment by Council woman Artego. Go ahead Council Member Artego. Thank you, Mr. President. These bills came to committee last week or week before. And I just want to share my concern about the fact that several of these are for the mezzanine on concourse B, which previously were done as sort of a master concession. And although there are still two years left on that contract, this particular concessionaire was allowed to select the folks that are coming in, which will all have a 10 year lease. And the inconsistency of which ones get to get a seven year lease versus which ones get to get a 10 year lease is consistently inconsistent and extremely frustrating for me. And I'm sure it is for those concessionaires who aren't always treated equal. So when you have restaurants that some get seven years and some get 10 years, that wears that fairness and the equity. So I'm not calling these out for a vote tonight. I abstain from the vote in committee because I was waiting for more information. But we've got one concessionaire that has 16 locations. The airport has a 25% cap on concentration of ownership. And I don't know how this particular concessionaire has not met that concentration of ownership. I know that not each one is 100% owned by that

concessionaire, but the concern that I have is around our practices that consistently change. We flex the rules, it used to be a 20% concentration of ownership. We changed it because we had a concessionaire that DIA wanted to keep there. And so that bumped up to 25%, which is what that cap is now. And so I think we need to ensure that we have consistency in the application of the rules so that they don't deviate from one to another depending on who we want in and who we want out of these concession spaces. And that in itself ensures that we don't get sued as a city as we have seen happen in the past. And so I'm just expressing that frustration with the process. And I'm gonna let them go forward, but I just think that as an airport, it's something that we need to monitor more carefully and ensure that we've got consistency in how all the rules are being applied to everyone equally. Thank you. Thank you Councilwoman Artega. This came up in Mayor Council. We had a chance to have the legal definition and protection of how this happened. And so I feel good with this legally, but I do share your concern around the consistency. And this was a different type of negotiation. So I will be supporting this as well. And it was just a comment. So we're gonna move on to, actually there are no bills have been called out. So we're gonna move on to the black votes. All other bills have been ordered published. We're now ready for black votes on resolutions and bills on funding consideration. Council members, remember this is a consent or black vote. You'll need to vote aye or otherwise this is your last chance to call an item for a separate vote. Councilwoman Artega, will you please put the resolutions for adoption of the bills on funding consideration for final passage on the floor? We'll do.

Public hearing for council bill 117 and Marley is now open. Andrew Webb. Good to see you sir. May we have the staff report. Absolutely. Thank you. Good evening Andrew Webb from community planning and development. This is a request to change the legal description adopted with a previous rezoning ordinance for 1400 and 1436 south Irving street. It's in council district three in the Marley neighborhood. This is about a just under three acre property at the intersection of Florida and federal contains apartment several apartment buildings in one single unit home. And the property owner request here is to correct the legal description associated with ordinance number 2017 0729. You may recall this council adopted zone change in August of 2017 from PUD 180 to SMU three for this property. During a subsequent application to community planning and development the applicant and their surveyor noticed some errors in the legal description that had been provided with the original documentation for the zone change and requested that that be changed in the ordinance. We worked with the city attorney's office to determine the appropriate process here and ultimately it was referred to the ludy committee per the section of the zoning code that allows for a truncated review and public hearing process for correction of an error. It was approved as part of the ludy consent agenda on February 6th. We did post signage and complete all the required all the requirements of the 21 day public notification and we have not received public comments about this request. As I mentioned this proposal just corrects an error in the legal description. It does not change the zoning of this property so the consistency with review criteria for rezoning can be presumed by the council's findings in the original rezoning case. Without I'm happy to answer any questions. Okay. Wow. That was quick. Questions for members of council? Actually we need our speaker. We do have one speaker. I'm sorry. Chairman Seku. We have one speaker tonight. Chairman Seku, you have three minutes. Please come to the podium. Good evening and it's good to see you guys. My name is Chairman Seku. I represent the Black Star Action Movement for self-defense advocacy for poor working poor homeless senior citizens also. This process that we're having a conversation around seems to be something that is minor and inconsequential and folks caught this thing so they wouldn't have later on down the road consequences and I remember I don't know it's maybe 18 years ago when we came to the same thing. Only problem was Kelly had caught something about the story of a description of a thing and it was missing a comma instead of a period and that kind of thing but it had an impact on the interpretation of what was being said and so we thanked her for finding that out because it could have substantial implications in the future and so these things don't seem like they're much but what it represents is the effort of the city being able to document, cross the eyes, do the t's and then make sure that this thing is found out that's an error that it may seem small but it needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed immediately when it's brought to attention so we want to thank you for doing that and we also want to thank council and other folks for bringing that to the attention. Now what this establishes this no excuses for allowing things no matter how small they are to become unattended

which means that once we create the habit of paying attention to the details then less will fall through the cracks and then everybody don't have to run when the light comes off like scattered cockroaches looking for blame when it ain't not. It's just something that was a human error and we make that all the time because we're human beings but also we have the responsibility as human beings when we see a mistake to correct the mistake otherwise as my grandfather was saying you have made a bigger mistake so thank you very much for the work that you guys do doing what you do thank council for the work that they do to make sure these things don't happen and if we apply the same habit to the little things and we apply it to the largest scope of things that impact people on a bigger level then maybe perhaps we can have that teamwork to make the dream work with the least amount of headaches. I got eight more seconds. I'm gonna let you have this. All right. Thank you. Nice socks. Okay. Thank you Chairman Seku. This concludes our speakers. Are there any questions by members of council? Oh a bunch of questions here. Okay. Councilman Flynn. Thank you Mr. Brazil. I don't know about a bunch of questions but I am curious if you could explain a couple of things who made the error and was this error contained in the legal description back all the way back at the beginning I think in 1994 or whenever this was first developed has that error been in there and does that create any problem? Council Member Flynn the the new zoning our legal description was created for the 2017 rezoning and it was as you are probably aware when application for rezoning is received we send it to our public work survey staff to ensure that it's correct. They look to make sure that the legal description doesn't contain any right-of-way that sort of thing and in the back and forth between our staff and the applicant's agent there were a couple of grammatical errors that did not get noticed at that time and were called to our attention later. Okay. All right. Thank you. That's all Mr. President. Thank you Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espino's I just wanted to confirm that in the documents what we're looking at is just a portion of the legal description correct not the total legal description on the slide. I do have a slide that actually shows the red-lined legal description here so you can see what the changes actually are. Yeah so okay that tells me yes we're only looking at a portion here and it's oh no actually yeah so we're only talking about the little bump out not the not the balance of the site. The this what you're adopting tonight would actually just reestablish the entire legal description for the original adoption ordinance for the rezoning. It's formatted a little bit differently but it should it should be this entire text you see here. All right. You might want to double check that because that is a much smaller portion in the area that was part of that rezoning. Okay. So that's why I was just trying to confirm that we're just looking at a portion of the total legal description that would have defined that zoning but okay yeah that is a fraction of of that entire area. Okay we did we'll definitely take a look at that but we did confirm this repeatedly this time with Public Works and with a surveyor that that the applicant had actually hired to do a new an updated legal description. Okay great thank you. All right so you know the questions the public hearing is now closed Councilman Lopez this is your district would you love to come in? Yeah it just seems like the obvious correcting the the actual title and description. A lot of times we don't pay attention to the actual description. A lot of people think this is just the address but it's actual property lines and that's a big deal when you're trying to either borrow against it and to improve a property or anything else. When you have that kind of problem you have a problem with the bank you have a problem with being able to do upgrades anything like that when it comes to financing things like that. These these are apartments that I've known for a very long time my actual my aunt my uncle my cousins lived in these apartments for a long time so I know exactly which ones they are and if this I'm just assuming but if it just stands to make

a correction to do upgrades the in bad need so this is affordable housing folks this is these are apartments that before was a popular they are actually affordable and that's disappearing quick so I'm glad we're able to make this correction. All right thank you councilman Lopez seeing no other comments Madam Secretary roll call. Lopez. Aye. New. Ortega. Aye. Sessman. Aye. Black. Aye. Clark. Aye. Espinosa. Aye. Flynn. Aye. Cashman. Aye.

All right we have 11 ayes. We'll now enter into executive session when council returns on the floor from executive session tonight's meeting will be adjourned. In the city of Minneapolis we really have seen just I think increasing support for this system as opposed to more divided opinion about did we do the right thing. So that has been the tone in the tenor in the city of Minneapolis. Am I up there? Oh yeah here I am sorry about that. Here's a couple of key findings to share from 2017 again this is our third time that we've used ranked choice voting and this was one thing that was just super we we had this big surge and so you saw the mayor elect in the video at the beginning he talked about having 45 percent. Let's see how do I get this whoops so this is just a little graph that shows how much we increased normally you would see in a general election more like in the 30s as a turnout in a general just municipal election I don't know what in Denver sort of your general turnouts are in your more general election and then you can see the line down there about the primary so a we had tremendously increased participation in this election but also regardless of even with the lower participation it was much different who you were playing to as a candidate if you did not have a primary. All right that was just I'll just go through that. Okay so this is the next thing that happened in Minneapolis in our 2017 election and I'll we have an example from the mayor's race and then we have an example from a candidate's race that I want to share but we just had tremendous participation in people ranking their ballots so they didn't just show up and rank their favorite candidate they ranked at least two and many ranked three candidates and so here if you're able to I think this is kind of small but I will read out in the mayor's race 87 percent of voters ranked at least two candidates 73 percent of voters ranked at least three candidates and I will say and again when we look at the mayor's example you'll see this a little bit more we had an interesting field in city elections in Minneapolis in 2017 where we probably had I consider five of those candidates for mayor to have visible and viable campaigns and when we look at this election I'll kind of tell you who raised the most money and who didn't and you'll see it's kind of surprising actually when you look at who won. We had a valid ballot rate of almost 100 percent and again that was explained this means that people filled out their

ballot correctly and also we have a system in Minneapolis where you can feed your ballot into the machine and it will kind of spit it out if you haven't filled it out correctly so we have a mechanism to automatically assist with that. We had just a tremendously diverse slate of candidates again I think this goes to this issue of who who is who is electing these candidates so now you are as a candidate you have one election it's more about turnout it is about reaching as many voters as possible it's about talking to everyone that you can even those who have said someone else is my first choice and we heard candidates say that they felt more comfortable coming into the race even if they weren't sure how viable they were in the beginning so we ended up with again just a very diverse slate of candidates these are people who were elected the first two transgender council members were elected in the first Somali American and Latina council members were reelected in this election and for Minneapolis this is a big change and again this is not fully reflecting the whole slate of candidates who are running all right let's see I'm going to skip that okay so I wanted to get to this example from the mayor's race so here we have let's see one two three four five so we have essentially what I talked about were these top five my year old candidates and then this was other so again this was kind of an interesting race we have an incumbent who was running for your election and she did not win her race two years four years ago when we had a mayoral election we had what I think is had been more traditional than what I had seen which is that you had like a couple of candidates just sort of rise above the pack and kind of hold on to that so it felt even though like there were more candidates it felt like there were two main candidates that was not the feel in Minneapolis this year you saw I'm gonna go through here so here they first eliminated the other candidates and we knew who won the mayor's race we had an inclination of who might win the day of the election and we had final confirmed results for the mayor's race by the early afternoon of the next day so those ballots moved to voter second choices um round two round three Nakema Levy pounds is eliminated she was the African-American woman who was featured in the early video she was a candidate I'll just say in the last elections report that I saw she raised only $40,000 so I just want to say this is like an election where someone like that who I will say was someone who had a lot of popular following um was able to come out um in the top five candidates in a competitive uh race all this in she had a baby uh on the campaign trail um yes um Tom Hoke is eliminated I'll just want to mention him because he was a candidate who raised the most money um he spent a lot of his own personal fortune um he raised about $750,000 that he spent on the race um so he was gone next I'll just flip through this because I will say on our elections website which you can see at vote.miniapolismn.gov they have a very interesting graphic that shows how people's votes uh went once they were eliminated and so you might just want to take a look at that Betsy Hodges is eliminated she was the incumbent mayor her um and then we had whoops then we had a winner with 57% of uh of counted ballots or continuing ballots all right this is one other race just to kind of take a look at because there's this kind of shorter story to tell here um this was a race between um a 20-year incumbent and uh she had two challengers um this was a race we we do do endorsing of candidates in Minneapolis nobody was endorsed in this race by the party um although the challenger Philippe Cunningham was the closest um and um what ended up happening here was uh so there's round one um there were two challengers Stephanie Gasca and Philippe Cunningham and in round two Gasca and then another candidate Hanson were eliminated um um there um Gasca and Cunningham clearly were aligned candidates um they uh and they ended up promoting a message towards the end of the campaign where they encouraged uh the other person's supporters to please rank them as their second

choice so there was an alignment that that happened there and in the end even though Barb Johnson was first in the early round um Philippe Cunningham received the lion share of these other votes this was a big story he was um uh he was a surprise candidate to win that race and this is just another graphic of that but she she was not successful the incumbent in attracting enough second choice votes to put her over the edge and this is uh the winner um Philippe Cunningham um I think I've taken up quite a bit of time here but I will just say um that I feel sad that we weren't able to have our elections uh our city clerk here Casey Carl um he had to deal with a recount in one of our races and he's preparing for you know a new mayor and a bunch of new council members um but uh people should feel free to reach out um to Casey Carl and the city of Minneapolis he has been a great advocate of how to institute this elections method uh well with integrity our elections team has won some national awards and also just to this point of engagement with voters um I feel like our whole elections team has continued just to be creative and how to engage with voters it's like the workaround ranked choice voting has ushered in a whole new um kind of way to do the work of the elections department where they now perceive that part of their work is about continuously educating and engaging with voters making sure they have good information about how to fill out their ballots and all this kind of thing so um it has ushered in um also a lot of policy changes at the city of Minneapolis on how to make things work the best way that they can for voters so thanks for letting me share our story thank you Elizabeth one more speaker um and thanks thanks for uh sticking with us and um terrific set of information being presented I hope I'll um say the one part of the Minneapolis story that sort of jumps out to me from like looking at that mayoral result is that if it had been the old system in Minneapolis and those first choices had translated into votes which you don't know for sure would have happened but it would have been the two biggest spenders to white men would have advanced and been the only general election candidate when turnout was much higher but they had this sort of richer debate with with with more people which is analogous to what Denver where you don't have this sort of win-a-win election you have everyone run in the first round um and someone can win in the first round but some of the systems out there wouldn't allow that um and uh say Paul also used ranked risk voting and they sort of interesting example of it was a big open seat race for mayor people thought it would have multiple rounds um 10 candidates running and a candidate ultimately won 51 percent of first choices so sort of uh sort of pushed forward and uh people will be the first African American mayor of St. Paul but part of the coverage of it that I've really appreciated just following was that people you know felt that all these candidates contributed to the dialogue about the city so even if it sort of looked like a first round result where just it was normal you had sort of people be be be be part of the part of the dialogue and and and part of what he as a successful candidate had to learn how to be people's second choices uh so our last speaker is going to be Connie Schmidt and um one of the the the great uh advances for us at Fair Vote is the the rise of the ranked risk voting resource center which is uh run by uh former election officials all with some direct experience with ranked risk voting but who can really get into how to make this work and how it's working and be a resource to communities and states as as they look at ranked risk voting and Connie is is an example of what a great asset they have she was election commissioner for Johnson County Kansas for nine years uh City Clerk for Merriam Kansas for 20 years has been doing a lot of consulting uh was done from work with the uh election assistance commission and uh direct uh consulting to Casey Carl and some work in uh Minneapolis so Connie Thank you Rob and thank you

Amber and your group for hosting this event it's a very nice turnout we're very happy to be here um as Rob said my background is totally in um local government and service to the public and um the last nine years were spent um but the best job on earth which was managing elections in the large county and Kansas in the Kansas City metro area since then it's been a lot of my privilege to work around the country um with a lot of um initiatives in various states and jurisdictions um in 2011 2013 2017 in Minneapolis where I learned for the first time about ranked choice voting the last couple of years it's been another privilege for me to be associated with a team of people that developed the ranked choice voting resource center and I'm really excited about it because it is basically um a place where any election administrator voter public official anyone candidate if you have any questions about ranked choice voting you can go to this website rankedchoicevoting.org and you will find all of the information that we have been able to find anywhere across the country and so the group that I'm working with as Rob said are retired uh and former election administrators um we're very big believers in elections and sharing best practices so that no one has to reinvent the wheel and so um we're very proud of everything that we have there it's from all the jurisdictions across the country who have um implemented ranked choice voting from legislation um to any other kind of ideas that are there um part of the things that it includes is a compilation of really what is ranked choice voting and so you can click on various tabs on the website if you're a voter or you're a candidate or you're an election administrator and go to various places of information that would help you understand what it is um for example there's information on how to mark your ballot and so you if you were a voter or if you were running for office there's information there um from other places across the country including samples um we have information on single-winner ranked choice voter and multi-winner ranked choice voting races um the election toolkit is probably one of my favorite places um we have started this year um a webinar series that we've been doing online and i'll talk a little about that in a moment um we have a lot of reports and presentations that we have done across the country and various reports that i'll um talk about we've been working with the center-fecivic design on usability toolkits and education toolkits um so the first thing um the webinar series and those webinars are posted on that website so if you're interested in you want of them or all of them you can go on your own and view those um the first one we did was to introduce everybody to really what the ranked choice voting resource center is and how we can help you and i need to add that our services are provided free of charge to any jurisdiction including travel so we are here um as a resource and to help in any way we can one webinar was basically the ABCs of ranked choice voting and that was kind of a um a introduction to what is ranked choice voting and what does it mean where is it being used and then we've done one on the history going back to the beginning of when ranked choice voting was first started in the united states and then the usability studies on how to design a ballot voting systems capabilities including statewide how do you do this for a whole state and designing the most important which is voter education and how to present election results to the voters we're going to be doing more webinars um in 2018 and again those are all going to be posted on our website as we go along um the toolkit um has a variety of reports and presentations that our team has put together um the first one we did we called it the ranked choice voting compilation and you can print it out there it has active hyperlinks throughout the document that will take you to other best practices across the country but it's basically just that it's where has this been done before how can I see what was done before how can I get an example of how someone else that managed elections did this and so that's where we'll find that the other report that I think is really good is implementation um of ranked choice voting with multiple voting

systems you're fortunate in Colorado you have all one voting system statewide not every state has that convenience there are many states that have um various voting vendors throughout the jurisdictions and the model RCB implementation plan is one that we've just finished in September and it basically takes it's a road map that we put together for any jurisdiction that was thinking about going to ranked choice voting as a model for managing elections from how do you pass legislation what are some examples of model legislation that you can take a look at and print off um to how do you do voter education all the way through how do you build the ballot and how do you actually provide election results on election night so there's a lot of really good information in um these reports and presentations um the one thing I wanted to um talk about very briefly is the center for civic design um we have several reports on the website that they have done they've been a wonderful partner to fair vote and the ranked choice voting resource center I think you have some handouts on your table on the website we have the principles and guidelines report that was done by their team the ballot design testing documents and I understand they're going to be here in Denver um later this month to do some more for you all voter education testing documents and they did go to Minneapolis and they have tested a lot of this information there and how do you present election results on election night um to your voters and to the candidates so some of the highlights um for their design report and I have to say many of these when I was reading through these preparing this PowerPoint pertain to elections in general and I think one of my colleagues earlier said the same thing it's really not any different than just managing the normal election so many of the guidelines you're going to see for the center for civic design pertain to any election that you're doing give voters the information they need to prepare to vote the only thing is when you're going to rank choice voting from a normal regular election where they just vote for one person you have to explain the benefits and the basics of what is ranked choice voting be prepared to answer their questions and be able to show voters how their ballot is actually going to be used in counting and tallying election results um and so one way to do that is this is a sample they may be on your tables I think I might have seen this one um that the center for civic design put together so basically in very simple language what is ranked choice voting why are we using it with as few awards as possible and you notice their icons and their words at the bottom for why it's being used save money stronger voices broader participation and so those simple words can can help a voter and the general public understand more about how to use it so that's an example that they put together another guideline that they presented was all of the information should be in clear and simple language any of us that have been in elections for any period of time have this kind of pounded into us clear and simple language is very important keep the information short and to the point and use everyday words so that anyone will be able to understand it in elections we kind of call it kindergarten words you know make it simple for everyone use illustrations anytime you can and use icons very sparingly to draw attention to different types of information and I have added the Minneapolis voter guide from 2017 and they're really proud of it they've done a great job in Minneapolis through the years improving each year on the process their mission um that we kind of started in 2013 was to be the gold standard for ranked choice voting and I'm so proud to say that they really are um so this voter guide that they did in 2017 utilize the information from the Center for Civic design on how to do this best some other information that was presented um is the how to do election results on election nine and as Councilwoman Glidden pointed out the Minneapolis folks really set a high standard in the 2017 election if you can go to their website and click on the mayor's race you can see this really marvelous visual of how each ground of tabulation moved various results from one candidate to the other candidates so they did a very very good

job on that but use a combination of text and graphics to tell your story use color and shading icons to draw attention to the various pieces it's important to include the details of where their voters expect them and use labels to remind the voters of the most important information and probably the most important thing is to use plain language if you're explaining local or state laws and terms and just very few words to help people understand an example is this visual I think it's on your table that the center for civic design created for us in partnership and it does show how each person's unique ballot and vote for each round is being tabulated and so anytime you can do any kind of a visual something like this it really helps the voters and the general public and I have to say the media too because we have to educate the media on what is ranked choice voting and how it is secure and how we are going to tabulate the results and so I wanted to show you a couple more examples of a way you can present this information so that the public can understand how the votes are being reallocated to other candidates as the tabulation occurs on election night everybody is used to having election results before the 10 o'clock news right well and sometimes in ranked choice voting we it takes a little bit longer as the gentleman from Alameda indicated that they still are counting mail ballots after the election night so the same thing is going to happen with ranked choice voting it will take some time to pull all the election results together some of the candidates will automatically win on election night if they receive over 51 percent of the vote those that don't will have to go into the rounds of tabulation this is an example of a grid style ballot is there on your left if you're looking at it on your right is the columns and there are various ways you can design the ballot Minneapolis allows ranking of up to three voters three candidates I'm sorry other jurisdictions rank up to six and maybe up to 10 candidates that's a decision that you'll have to make but you'll notice the voter instructions at the top it's really important to show a little visual for what they how to actually mark the ballot and it's that that's a really important piece of all of it I wanted to talk a little bit about educating the public again and partial to Minneapolis because that's where I've worked in ranked choice voting but they've done a really good job on their website and I have the address their vote manyapolismn.gov and you can go there and just get all kinds of background information for how they implemented it starting in 2009 they use social media I know y'all do here in Denver too Twitter Facebook to keep the public and the voters and the candidates informed and engaged in the entire process including on election night when we were doing tabulation the use of Twitter and Facebook was a really good way to keep everybody engaged they have a video I'm going to show at the end on how tabulation occurs that's on their website also they do voter outreach handouts in various languages the one that really helped them the most I think is the voter information guide mailing they mail this to every household in the city of Minneapolis and in ranked choice voting elections which is once every four years they include more information about what ranked choice voting is and how it works and they do a post-election survey they have in 2013 I believe they did it again this year surveying election workers and voters and various people and the voter guide was identified as the most effective tool for learning about ranked choice voting but I have to stop here and again always say that our most important informant of to the voters is our poll workers in the polling places on election day my colleagues in North Carolina who did a ranked choice voting statewide election in a very short period of time the poll workers in the polling places are the ones that really really helped inform the voters and be sure they had the right information how it works educating the voters I have this handout available over here if some of you would like to take that this is what Minneapolis uses it tells people how not to do what not to do with the big red circle and the line drawn through it it also provides information at the bottom about how to count

your vote and it also says that if you've made a mistake on your ballot you can please ask for another ballot and you can start over so that is like a poster that's in every voting location which is also really really good I wanted to give you just a couple of statistical things because I love statistics and looking back on Minneapolis this is from November of 2013 I don't know they have all of these numbers put together from this past November's election but I think it's important to note that the over votes in are very very less than less than 0.5% which is probably comparable to any normal election that you have skipped rankings there was again less than 0.5% they repeated the candidates in a few and so that was an area they identified by looking at these statistics that they had to do a little better job on voter education and so that's the benefit of doing some of these post-election statistics and analysis of how the ballots were actually voted you can see where do you need to continue to engage with the voters to be sure that they understand the next one relates to how many people voted how many choices how many people were ranked in the mayor's race in 2013 while over 75% of the voters did three choices they ranked all three choices again there were a lot of candidates for mayor you'll notice if you can see this I'm not sure if everyone can the city council race that only had one candidate well of course only 96% of the people ranked more than only but only ranked one candidate because it was only one but if you look down any race that had more than three or four candidates they chose at least three choices when they were ranking their ballot and so these are really good statistics to go back and look at post-election when you can review everything after you've got the election certified the last thing I want to show is the video and let me see if I can do this this is on the city of Minneapolis website and it's a really nice little simple easy to understand visual about how we're going to count the votes on election night so I'm going to see if this were oops it didn't work so I'm going to rely on the gentleman to make it go in most elections you only vote for one candidate for each office but in some elections voters can rank three or more candidates for each office it's called ranked choice voting here's an example of how it works all of the candidates will be listed on the ballot in three columns make your first choice vote in column one by filling in the oval of the candidate you'd most like to win vote for your second choice in column two and make your third choice in column three that's all there is to it now let's see how the votes are counted let's say there are four candidates running for mayor Asha, Zach, Omar and Lucy once the polls close we count all the first choice votes first to be elected mayor a candidate needs more than half the votes in this example Asha has more than half of the votes so she's declared the winner however if no candidate gets more than half the votes we start eliminating candidates and counting the next choices of those who voted in this example Zach is the candidate with the smallest number of first choice votes so he is cut we use the second choice votes on Zach's ballots and count those voters second choices instead if one of the remaining candidates now has more than half of the total votes that candidate is declared the winner if not the next lowest candidate Lucy is eliminated her votes are now counted for the next choice on the ballot some of Lucy's votes went to Zach who was already eliminated so those new votes for Zach instead count for those voters third choice candidate we are now down to two candidates and Omar clearly has more than half of the votes that makes him the winner that's how ranked choice voting works for more information on ranked choice voting visit our website okay thank you all right thank you Connie so I think we're actually going to try to get a hands-on experience next so maybe Amber will introduce us to that opportunity okay so we've got a couple of ways that we can test this out first you have some paper ballots that should be on your table we also have the tablets that are in the back of

the room against the far wall once we collect everything we will count in the in the tabulation room and bring the results out and show what those look like on the screen I think what I'll do is I'm going to kick off with one question that I have just given Denver and the jurisdiction that we have here in the city and county of Denver and the question I have is actually for Dave McDonald he being from Oakland is a section 203 county which means they have multiple languages that they present their ballots in and so my question really is given that Denver is also a section 203 county we put all of our ballot materials and instructions out in Spanish I wonder if you could share some information maybe about your experience with multiple languages for voters in Oakland thanks yeah it's a real challenge when I was a registrar we had three languages English, Spanish, and Chinese and anything you do in English you have to do in those other two languages so if you have an English poll worker you have to have a Spanish-speaking poll worker and they have to be bilingual which is interesting I got in trouble with the OJ because we had a really hard time finding enough bilingual Chinese poll workers I could find poll workers who spoke only Chinese but limited English even though we had other English-speaking poll workers there that was not good enough for DOJ and so they dinged us pretty hard on even though we had the poll worker there was not bilingual so it is a challenge finding staff as well that speak those languages and I think now I think LA is up to nine languages Los Angeles is up to nine different languages so when you look at your ballot it gets even more complicated because you can have all the languages on one ballot or you can have separate ballots for each language which means in California our ballots are huge it's not unusual for us to have five ballot cards so imagine all the boxes you have English boxes, Spanish boxes, Chinese, and so on whatever the other languages are and so it is it is it's tough to do it is real hard so my hat's off to anybody that does multiple languages three is is two isn't too bad it's English and Spanish because we you can have a bilingual ballot with both languages on a single piece of paper but get passed to it it's even more complicated so I don't know if that answers the question one thing I'll add just about about these Bay Area elections in particular but also just about sort of this general question of racial and ethnic minorities and a ranked-risk ballot in the Bay Area as Dave is saying there's big ballots because they're voting on a lot of things I think San Francisco in 2016 had more than 30 city ballot measures if I'm remembering right and more than 10 state ballot measures and voting for president and many other offices and then down to the Board of Supervisors using ranked-risk voting so when you're sort of seeing ranked-risk voting results it's in a climate where people are voting on a lot of things you know a whole lot of people voting by mail a whole lot of people voting in person a whole lot of people you know you know most therefore voting for president or something and you are seeing you know really pretty effective use of the ranked-risk ballot across demographics now you'll you'll still see kind of a mirror of the the differences of how lower income voters sort of handle ballots than higher income voters but one thing we've looked at very closely is when you're particularly when you're placing two rounds of election almost always one of them has lower turnout than the other and when it has lower turnout it's sort of disproportionately lower among those communities so any differences that you see and how people of color may be handling say a ranked-risk ballot is much bigger or magnified when it's actually the differences of a turnout that you see the last thing I'll mention on that is New York City used to have 32 local school board elections using ranked-risk voting did it from like the by 1970 to the to to about 2000 and there were nine of them and or no 32 of them with nine seats on each one so a lot of offices but they were voting by counting by hand and people are like oh that's kind of a pain why don't we move them to voting on equipment and and not use

the ranked-choice system and the Department of Justice at that point had to pre-clear changes to the New York City ballots under under section five of the Voting Rights Act and that was actually the last time the DOJ denied pre-clearance to a change because they thought it would be an adverse impact on racial minorities to take away the ranked-choice ballot because of the effective use that they were making of the ranked-choice ballot so I think we're just going to people should line up because I because I think we want to have questions from the microphone so why don't why don't we do that hello hi thanks first of all I want to say thank you it was an awesome presentation but this is a policy question for those that really implemented it in terms of how did you decide on how many choices you were going to give the electorate for each candidate or each race so I'll just Minneapolis ours was actually dictated by what our elections equipment could handle so that's why we had only three choices our sister city of St. Paul has up to six choices because they handled it in a different way and so they had different policy choices and the same thing in Alameda County we had three choices really just because our voting system could only handle three and what we're seeing in the new generous equipment including I think the Dominion system that people just were trying out that that I believe can do up to 10 rankings so we're going to generally see I think in with with that kind of ballot design an increased number of rankings I think it's certainly sensible to you know when it's five or six seven candidates to kind of allow people to rank that many just as one thing and just about what voters want to do is that in the New York of rather sorry in the in the 2016 presidential cycle we did a poll with College of a William and Mary when the time of Iowa caucuses and Republican contests or 11 candidates and we invited people to rank the candidates we didn't say please rank them all we said we invited them to rank Kansas these were a thousand likely Republican voters from around the country and more than nine out of ten chose to rank everybody and you really saw a lot of coherence and and meaning in their rankings including Donald Trump was the plurality first choice leader and the plurality last choice candidate it's kind of an interesting example of how voters were reacting to his candidacy yeah I was just going to say San Francisco I think the initiative was a full ranking but there within the initiative it was written to have the option for through only three if that's what the voting equipment would only allow so San Francisco has this elastic thing built into the initiative that they can go to full ranking hi my name is Raffi my question is more so directed today but please if anyone has incites China you had mentioned voter education being a priority when alameda adopted rank choice what was your process in actually gathering your advisors from the community who did you decide to select who did you include in the process yeah it was pretty pretty open the legal women voters was a very active participant and so they had several representatives and also in each of the cities there's a you know alameda county is a pretty liberal area we have a lot of activists you know we're home to Berkeley anybody heard of Berkeley here so a pretty liberal city and so there was a very large community of activists and so I invited some of them to be on the committee and it was pretty open I mean kind of whoever wanted to be on it with as long as they weren't too disruptive I only had to call a sheriff a couple of times but you know so we had a lot of people on the advisory committee because I figured the more input the better and I and you know what happens when you have a committee like that people are all excited at first and then kind of the friends drop out and the ones who are really interested hang in there through the whole time yeah you know um I feel like our voter education work has changed each each election and it's not just about rank choice voting we also had some other reforms from the state of minnesota that I would say sort of layer on to what's happening with rank choice voting including we adopted early voting for the

state and that is again then just a different layer of of kind of how the engagement works in the I think in the original year when the when the materials were developed we had a similar process to what you did where there was sort of an open invite to engaged constituencies organizations that worked in the community trying to get really community-based feedback and we use that to develop some of the materials but not just the materials it was more about then what do we do to resource kind of getting out into the community and I would say that's sort of like the biggest thing that has continued every election is I swear there's elections workers but also other kind of nonpartisan groups that just cover the city it feels like for pretty long time during the elections season so there is just a lot of voter engagement happening a lot of again a lot of nonpartisan voter participation kind of work happening around rank choice voting now it's that one thing and maybe jarard you can amplify on this but my recollection about san francisco is that you know it did a lot of the upfront work which is you often see like in the first election and then they do less going forward but they did use some of the cost savings that they were getting from going to rank choice voting to ultimately have more lasting staffers involved in voter education for everything if if I'm correct me if I'm wrong but they but but then that's there was sort of a new you know so the city's saving money but it's it's using a little bit of that to now have staffers who do voter education throughout the time is that well currently it's currently it's the staffers who do the outreach and community but when the ranked choice voting was implemented a lot of the outreach was contracted out we had groups like the gray panther senior citizen group they were funded by department elections to have people from their organization go out and make presentations so we actually had some community funding I think the first first two cycles just to do a very blanket outreach hi my name is Celeste landry and I was happy today to see that there was a two-winner race on today's election because there is a council member race like that in the denver ballot and I want to let people know that I have copies of the Cambridge ballots for this year where they have 26 rankings for city council and 12 for the school committee and this afternoon Robert she and I are going to be giving a talk on multi-winner ranked elections at 130 at the Denver Press Club if anybody wants to attend that and I wanted to ask Elizabeth because Minneapolis also has a multi-winner race so could you talk a little bit about how that works some people won't be able to make it this afternoon so you'll be all they probably here thanks sure it um this is sort of one of these things honestly like the explaining feels a little more complicated than what it is but we have a park board at large positions three and they are elected differently so on your ballot as you fill out the ballot you select three and then that will ultimately be selected as your three park board candidate so it's different than for each park board candidate that you would have three choices who's going to fill spot one versus spot two versus spot three so it's just a a different way a different mechanism and this was again because of how those seats were set up in our city charter originally kind of dictated how that how that happened it's sort of one of these races honestly where I feel like you can get into the weeds with how the counting works in the end how you fill out the ballot and which is I mean in the end the critical piece are people understanding the system are they feeling their ballot out correctly to me that as a someone who's been a candidate I've and kind of seen how those elections work I feel like that's a critical piece there is some ballot design issue to this as well sometimes there's some challenges presented by your elections vendor or your so so that's another issue you know and I'll just add that for a multi-winner election system sort of different algorithms or choices one can make there's sort of ways you can do it where it preserves a majority principle so you know you're interested in design when you're electing one person to uphold the

principal and majority rule and you can do that so each person has to has to do that when when a multi-winner more common is what they what they do for the park board elections where they do in Cambridge which is a which is to try to have as many people as possible help elect someone and so when you have more seats you can actually expand the numbers that are likely do that so in Cambridge you generally have at least 90 percent of people voting for a winner but they do that by having each winner not needing 90 percent to win or 50 percent to win but actually needing about a ninth of the vote to win and and and that's how that works but that's that's uh that's uh that's sort of a policy choice for for multi-winner races I thank you for doing this Councilman Paul Lopez represent the west side here in Denver two questions so and and they kind of have to do with each other and I think I alluded to them earlier in our private conversation but one I'm curious about the interface between this kind of ballot and an all-male ballot election and the the the conflict I would see that would present itself and wondering how you would reckon reconcile that or if there's a protocol to do so if somebody accidentally filled um first choice and fifth choice or for the same person by error in person you'd be able to come up and say hey I messed up kind of get another ballot printed how do you reconcile that that issue when it comes to an all-male ballot and just those dynamics and just want to know what your thoughts are with that dynamic well I can address that in Alameda County over half of our voters vote by mail and half go to the polling place so we kind of have that now so if you're at a polling place and you make a mistake on your ballot you know you vote for the same candidate twice and you feed it into the machine it'll kick it out right then and the poll worker will give you a fresh ballot and you can correct your mistake if you want to now if you're voting by mail you don't have that opportunity to correct the mistake so what we do is we scan all those vote by mail ballots through a high-speed scanner any ballots that are marked incorrectly will get kicked out and then we'll have staff go through and look at those and see if we can determine why so for instance sometimes what'll happen I'll vote for Rob as my choice and then I'll think about it and I'll scratch it out and vote for somebody else well the machine just sees two votes but if you look at it you can tell what the voter intent was so if we know what the voter intent is then we'll copy it to a fresh ballot does that I hope that answers the question so we we do our best shot but we can't catch them all yeah so I mean knowing what Denver elections does I mean it's the same kind of thought process but I'm just I'm just wondering if there's any policy and protocol on that so I'll just take this short conversation before I'll say what happened in Minneapolis and maybe this is kind of how you've ultimately dealt with it is we adapted an ordinance to ensure that kind of those policy protocols which are very kind of elections administrator kind of driven on what are those protocols and we're clear transparent and people understood how the ballot would be interpreted again with the intention you're going to give the most benefit of the doubt to the voter so that their votes count what was the name of that ordinance just we can find it and we can put it up on the I don't know where you're posting information but this because this is already addressed actually in most of our laws in Colorado but but we do with our dominion system which is different than what I think any of the systems that are up here we have what we call adjudication and so even now with our mail ballot process if a voter makes a mistake it goes on screen and then we have a whole review process a bipartisan review process where they resolve these discrepancies and so in a rank choice model we have a voter intent guide it's called and so you would still be able to resolve those discrepancies and and resolve them so that the ballot was counted appropriately we also

instruct the good thing about mail ballots and this is kind of one of the things that I know there was a reference to how great that kind of model is but with ballot delivery it gives us an ability to to send instructions so every voter in the city gets the exact same instruction and we're no longer relying on instructions happening verbally at polling places or things like that so we've really increased the consistency for how we deliver instructions for voting and we have an ability to design those instructions as we need to within the packet that every voter gets and so one of the things that's kind of happening in addition to this event is next week the Center for Civic Design is going to test out three different basically ways of designing ballots and three different types of instructions and ask voters for their feedback and then they'll be able to share all that data with us which I think is really important because the Center for Civic Design not only in ranked choice voting but they've been doing this work kind of with other types of voting and their research is really guiding the way that we now are designing instructions and certainly the way we've done it in Denver and Stu Club who's our our staff for that does a lot of this he's really tried to adopt the principles of best design so that so that people are getting more visual materials and better instructions and and you can even see that on some of the ballots that we did I think Jimmy used the Center for Civic Design principles which is really helpful for voters so there's a lot of things in there and and certainly with our voter intent structure and Colorado's law for elections we have those things where we always want to make sure that the voters intent is captured regardless and I'm keenly aware that I think Alton did a good job in one of our tours last time of kind of showing that behind the scenes process I'm just wondering if that prevalence of those errors increased compared to your typical ballot before or if they kind of stayed the same and I think you talked a little bit about it and just kind of our effect how that would work in our system so I appreciate that Amber. Thank you. Well I know the chart I showed you kind of showed the percentages for the various mistakes that voters might make and I do have a chart up here that City of Minneapolis did and corporate into their charter which is basically their voter intent guide and it's a nice visual that shows if there is a mistake in the first ranking that the second ranking then becomes the first choice vote and it shows how the voters ballot will be counted to the most that to the most voter intent can possibly be made. And I think the the issues are very similar for RCV and non-RCV races right you can make a mistake on a non-RCV race and still have to figure out how to get your ballot but the one thing that I believe and I'm going to confirm this I don't know if Dave has the numbers but but in I'm pretty sure that the rates of at least invalidated ballots are not anymore with vote by mail than the in person which is quite interesting when you think about it but they also have more time right so there's that's and that's again just vote by mail versus in a person voting for everybody but they have a little more time a little more time to think about the candidates and you know one of the things that's interesting about ranked votes voting is a crazy new incentives to find out more about candidates and candidates to tell you more about themselves and so there's a voters tend to learn a little bit more about their voting whether they're voting in person or voting by mail. Any more questions and then people should come to the microphone if they have one. Hi Elizabeth little page election judge coordinator for Denver how did ranked choice voting change your wait times for voters in lines. Well that's a good question you know it's we have such a complicated ballot in California so many ballot cards that we have to make sure we have enough voting booths in a polling place so I didn't see waiting times because of ranked choice voting delayed very much. During a a very exciting contest such as the presidential election yes there are lines out the door we we do a lot of early voting so

the usually 29 days before the election you can still come and vote and we would have lines out the door around the block because people were so excited about voting for the president and this during the first Obama election I know I had one woman came in she was first time she'd ever voted she was 105 years old and there was a huge line of people and so this is the one time I made the exception I let her take cuts and she came to the front of the line and she voted but really to answer your question the RCV does not really confuse people that much because it's fairly simple and there aren't that many contests really with RCV it's just your your local local races. I'll just add that in in Minneapolis I think similar to what you described we have election judges who are there just to make sure there's someone to explain the ballot if they're last minute questions again that's in addition to kind of all the other things that have happened and then just again we still in Minneapolis we have our municipal elections on a year where there are no other elections and so the 45 percent was humongous turnout for us so we do staff to make sure people don't have inappropriate waits but this is a different turnout kind of election than other elections presidential year elections. Any questions? My name is Ryan and I'm visiting here from Utah so I really appreciate you holding this event for us. My question revolves one of the virtues that we hear about ranked-choice voting an awful lot is that it eliminates plurality in elections and there are several instances in ranked-choice voting where plurality still is an issue one specific one maybe a Gerard can answer I'm in 2006 in San Francisco there were almost 20,000 votes cast in a district four race and the winner won that election with about 8,400 votes cast so by the time you exhaust some of those votes and things like that there is still the possibility to end up with kind of a false false majority on that of getting the 50 percent I just wonder if you could talk about that just a little bit. Well I'll start and then others can comment too so so in ranked-choice voting if you like in Australia people may know that Australia mandates voting and so it's not everyone votes but they can be fine for not voting they also in that spirit they mandate ranking right so they're really like trying to make a make a choice right and that's not something that's part of any ranked-choice voting election use in the United States or anywhere else that I know of and so if you don't mandate ranking then it's possible that you know that your top choices that you've ranked get eliminated and then your ballot's not going to count for someone right so that if you compare the first round totals with the last round totals there's a certain number of drop-off like people that have chosen not to rank in the places where they restrict rankings to three that can there be some people who rank three people who just don't get to the final two if it's where they don't have restriction on rankings it's sort of a voluntary abstention it's a choice to say you know what I don't care about and these other people you know I'm indifferent to them and I guess my belief has always been well if I'm indifferent to the other people it's sort of like not voting in the first but you know it's an abstention so that kind of drop-off which tends by the way to be a lot less than in regular runoff elections like the drop-off in regular runoff elections as I showed in that slide on average is almost 40% right in the congressional runoff primaries which I know that Utah say is debating and they might end up having you know congressional primary runoffs with probably drop-off to 30, 40 percent what you see kind of the drop-off you might see in a righteous voting election is more in the order of five to ten percent you know so it's people that drop-off in a really fractured race like this one in San Francisco you might be referring to no candidate got more than 11 percent of first-traces super you know it would have been a fractured race under any circumstance and and so a limit of three rankings there were a lot of ballots that didn't didn't end up counting when it got down to two but that's a real outlier the the rest are

usually in the sort of five to ten percent drop-off um so it's not necessarily a majority of the first round but it is a majority of the willing in a sense particularly if there's not a limit on rankings of people that made a choice they're having a chance to express it and and and so it's a majority of the final round might not always be a majority of the first round and if anyone else wants to add on to that I think that's a that's a good explanation I will say too where I and maybe Rob you can speak to this the majority vast majority of races seem to have something that is 50 plus one there are some including Minneapolis where we've had something again because of the drop-off where it is less than 50 percent but still the races I have seen have been in the high 40s so maybe you can speak a little bit to when we talk about plurality winner you know what what does that look like in ranked choice voting yeah and it's obviously there's a different different measure also of sort of what voters might be meaning like in the current Minneapolis mayor the race that just happened the winner was ranked in the top three out of it was 10 candidates for mayor 11 more something like that something a bunch of candidates and this person I think maybe even 15 or something right so ranked in the top three by more than half of voters however some of those voters ranked his opponent in the final round as a higher choice so he's deboused in count for him in the final choice because they were counting for someone else but those voters had made a sort of a expression of interest and support for for that candidate and so if you look at that way you almost always get the winners getting expressions of support for more than 50 percent and from in a sense from the voter perspective they made a sense feel feel represented by that person to a degree right you know like like they they made an affirmative decision to rank them but anyway that's sort of getting in the weeds but it is sort of a way that it's a different it's not just sort of a one-on-one thing it's a it's how you attract support from a from a community of people and certainly the candidates see it that way where they need to reach out to as many people as possible so when the the new mayor of Minneapolis you know got an affirmative expression of support for more than half the voters and that to me seems important. I just want to say something on that because and this isn't expressly answering that question but just on this point of how candidates look at being ranked I talked to the winning candidate in a race that wasn't featured in my presentation but also was very competitive there was a socialist candidate there was a green party candidate there was a kind of a business-minded DFL candidate and another DFL candidate and so the the winner was the DFL candidate who who called himself a kind of a progressive DFL candidate and he said to me after the race that he looked at the fact that he was ranked by 70 some percent of voters in in in the election I mean he was looking at who actually wanted to select him as one of their top three and that mattered to him because it helped him understand also the spread of where were the voters it gave him a very clear picture of where were the voters at in the war that he was elected to represent what was the contour of that and then where did he fall within that so I thought it was really interesting a comment to me by a winning candidate. Other questions? Can you anybody say at all talk at all about what the opposition has been as cities and entities have taken on ranked choice voting what are the common threads in that opposition and what are some of the strongest points that opposition groups have made. What's the tech of that? I can talk a little bit about it you know the I guess the opposition is a lack of understanding of what ranked choice voting is it's something different it's new and it can be confusing once you start diving down into some of the minutia so we got that a lot we got opposition because of cost even though I think if it's done correctly there's cost savings but initially you spend more money if you're going

to do a lot of outreach we had to buy we had to do all of our outreach we had to buy software to do our CV we had the additional poll workers so there was some initial expense that normally wouldn't be in an election but then you know the software gets amortized over multiple elections and that kind of goes away so the other thing I think that I kind of saw is elected officials and I know we have some in the room so don't take this personally but elected officials know how to win a certain kind of contest and now all of a sudden here's a ranked choice voting contest and this is different I've never won that kind of election so what do I do and so I think there's been a little bit of a learning curve there are some unrealistic expectations on candidates parts I know we had one mayor in one of the cities who was an ardent ardent supporter of ranked choice voting because it was he thought it was going to save him money and running his campaign you'd only have to run one campaign rather than two so he pushed it through the city and got it adopted well of course you know what happened he he lost the ranked choice voting contest and now he is an ardent advocate to eliminate ranked choice voting and he used to send emails all the time saying why did I make them do this so it was it was kind of funny to see that happen but so I think it's a it's really a lack of understanding sometimes about what it really means to win an election out of campaign so yeah and I think sorry I'll just add very quick then turn over Elizabeth which but I think is that one of the lessons learned in in Minneapolis in some ways has been a good example for for doing this which is to make sure that all the players and elections the people most involved really understand the system because if they go in misinformed and then lose like Dave was mentioned earlier some people go out there and say rank me first second and third thinking that helps and it doesn't help and and and if they find out later it didn't help and that you know it just just makes them feel stupid you know and then they're more more likely to feel like they shouldn't do it so just making sure that the the key players understand it and then understand outcomes which is one of the things that's interesting about that Minneapolis video which is showing both winners and losers sort of accepting the outcome we also had to deal with the situation in these early adoptions of ranked choice voting that there wasn't a turnkey solution to implementing it there would be taking over the world I think if that was going to happen it probably already would have with viruses which are basically nature's nanobots and even though it's cold and flu season viruses have not actually taken over the world they are limited by their resources and they compete with each other all the different types that are out there for those resources so even if there were nanobots out there that could replicate they would be competing with one another for resources and as they replicated they would change a little bit with each replication because it probably wouldn't be perfect so eventually you'd have all these different nanobots competing for these different for these resources and as a result they would

Saturday, January 25th, it will start at 11 a.m. And Sunday at 1.15, and this will all be in the Far East Center, which is at 333 South Federal Boulevard, Dragon Dance, Lion Dance, Drum Show, Tai Chi performances, some of the most amazing food you'll ever have. Parking is limited, so please plan ahead. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Torres. Council Member Herndon. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to make a few announcements. One, I want to thank everyone that participated in all the various Martin Luther King holiday festivities we had over the past weekend, including the parade that we had yesterday and which is why we are here on Tuesday for City Council, and I saw several of my Council colleagues, elected officials, really great event as always, and this was the 37th year, I believe they said that we have done this, but so thank you for all that continue to support that. Second of all, we had a ribbon cutting today in District 8. The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless acquired one of the studio hotels along Quebec, and so 139 units, 125 of those will be permanent housing for those experiencing homelessness, and 14 of those studio apartments will be bridge housing just for temporary as people transition to more permanent housing, so I want to congratulate the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and all the parties that were part of this to make this a reality, it's really exciting, and they will be moving in as early as next week, so really excited about that. And then lastly, Mr. President, I know at times Council members have acknowledged people that they recognize in the Council chambers before, so in the previous life, I had the pleasure of working for United Airlines as I look up, I just suddenly see some familiar faces, and one of my old bosses in here as well, and I just want to say lastly, that delay was not on the ramp. Thank you, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Council Member Herndon, Council Member Hines. Thank you, Mr. President, I also wanted to recognize that it appears that there are a couple people who are here from United Airlines as a Vice Chair of Biz Committee, who the airport goes through, I'd like to say that welcome, I'm certainly we could talk about you in, we will talk about you in a minute, but thank you for coming, thank you for representing so thoroughly, and I'm really excited that you and the residents of Denver and the airport can come to the agreement that we're going to discuss here in a few minutes, so thank you. Thank you, Council Member Hines, Council Member Sandoval, you back up? Yes, so sorry, I got caught up in my earlier announcement. So this Thursday, I am hosting a grand opening in my district office. I had made that promise on the campaign trail that I would move my office out of the city and county building, and I successfully was able to do that, so I will have some tamales and beans and green chili and yummy appetizers, alcohol-free event, given its city property. So it's BYOB, if you want anything, it's 1810 Platt Street, and it's from 4 to 7 p.m. This Thursday, I've announced it on Facebook and I would love anyone and everybody to stop by and see my beautiful space, thank

you. Thank you, Council Member Sandoval, that seeing no other announcements, we're going to move on.

Thank you very much. I'll do a quick recap under resolutions. No items have been called out under bills for introduction. No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. Council Member Sandoval has called out Council Bill 19-0913 for a vote. Under pending, no items have been called out. All right, I don't think I missed anything. Madam Secretary, if you please put the first item on our screens and Council Member Sandoval, your motion to take out of order. I think we need your microphone on there. Thank you. Thank you. I move that Council Bill 19-0913 be taken out of order. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council Member Sandoval? Thank you, Council President. Since the public hearing is not being held on this item tonight, we need a vote to take this item out of order on the agenda so that we may take an action on it tonight. May take an action on it now. Thank you, seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call. Sandoval, aye. Black, aye. Flynn, aye. Gilmore, aye. Herndon, aye. Hines, aye. Cashman, aye. Keniche, aye. Ortega, aye. Sawyer, aye. Torres, aye. Council President. Aye. Madam Secretary, please close voting and announce the results. Twelve ayes. Twelve ayes. Council Bill 0913 may be taken out of order. Council Member Cashman, will you please put Council Bill 0913 on the floor? Yes, sir. I move that Council Bill 19-0913 be placed upon final consideration and due pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council? Council Member Sandoval? Thank you, Mr. President. At the request of the applicants, the landmark application has been withdrawn as a part of an ongoing process to find a new owner. I am asking my colleagues to vote no to defeat the bill. So just a little bit of background, this was an application brought forward by the community against a potential buyer who was buying the property. And I sought out both parties and asked them to go to the meeting. And they had a couple facilitated conversations and actually came to a negotiation. And now the property is under contract with a new buyer. So this is a good outcome for District 1. We did not want this to come to Council by not having a non-owner historic designation. That's a very challenging situation. So I appreciate my colleagues votes to vote no and work this out on behalf of my community. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Sandoval. Seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call. Sandoval? No. Black? No. Flynn? No. Gilmore? No. Herndon? No. Hines? No. Cashman? No. Keniche? Ortega? No. Sawyer? No. Torres? No. Council President? No. Madam Secretary, please close voting and announce results. Twelve nays. Twelve nays. Council Bill 0-9-1-3 has been defeated. That concludes the items that are called out this evening. All bills for introduction are ordered published. Council Members, remember that this is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote aye. Otherwise, this is your last chance to call an item out. For a separate vote. Council Member Cashman, will you please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills on final consideration for final passage on the floor? Yes, sir. And these are all a series of 2020 unless otherwise identified. 0-0-3-0-0-3-1-0-0-2-5-0-0-2-6-0-0-2-7-0-0-2-8-19-13-79.

alright your motion to adopt doctor i move that proclamation eighteen dash zero five nine five be adopted it has been moved and seconded

i think i said the wrong numbers zero five nine three five nine five there we go we would have caught her madam secretary is on her toes over there okay and is moved and seconded comments boomers the council councilman

very much

councilman brooks and i have had the pleasure of attending on at these events this morning the opening ceremonies at the convention center and i'm telling you it's quite the thing to see we're very excited to have ip w here it's been

forty five years or something like that since we have had this convention here of people from all over the world coming to see denver and to looking at looking at it and and hopefully we'll go home and book trips here we like the tourists to come and spend money and then have a happy trip home

thank you councilman and and i'll just make a couple of comments i you know i think it's

city leaders all over america right now are are looking for funds to do more in their city and including these thirteen up here

they're looking for fees and all kind of things to to begin to fund housing and and rose and things like that and i always find it interesting that the city leaders never look at tourism

what this super bowl of city planning events will do to this city these six thousand planners event planners that are in the city right now over the next three to five years will accumulate billions of dollars of travel to the city and they go home which is so nice

but more important than that there is a r o y that each denver property owner is paying right now it's about eight hundred dollars off of your property taxes because our tourism industry is so strong and robust so it's important it's in

it's a it's a r ally for our citizens in denver and for those of us who are looking to fund important programs for the citizens who are up here it's an important revenue stream and so we can thank our branding agent visit denver enough for what you do

ooh for this city and every hotel room downtown is filled to capacity right now and around downtown and and those that lodgers tax and all that stuff is coming to benefit you the citizens and so i think it's really important that we understand that so i want to thank my colleague

for bringing this proclamation forward and i want to say to the six thousand event planners have a good time endeavor go home and bring another six thousand folks to invest in our city all right madam secretary roll-call

since this gun violence awareness month proclamation was read last year communities across the land have mourn dozens lost in school shootings as well as the tens of thousands of men women and children lost in random homicides and suicides

from sea to not so shining sea cnn lists the following school shootings thus far in two thousand and eighteen most won't ring a bell because they don't rise to the level of carnage

that we saw in parkland florida or santa fe texas

twentieth in winston salem north carolina

as this year

we here in denver

rightfully continue to mourn the horrific losses at columbine and at the aurora theater shooting and how fortunate we we might think that we are that these most recent shooting shootings didn't happen to us

but can we be sure that we were actually spared our mayor michael hancock was born in fort hood texas governor john hickenlooper came from narberth pennsylvania robin witness dean head of denver health grew up on the east coast doctor rebecca

chop chancellor of the university of denver came from rural kansas those of you in the audience please and my colleagues on the deus if you'll raise your hand if you were not born in denver

so lest you be comforted that these recent shootings haven't torn our community apart realize that just might be an illusion it might have been our future governor that died in texas the other day or our mayor or council president or a future

scientists poised to finally find a cure for some hideous childhood illness at the colorado children's hospital or a mould shattering police chief or educator or maybe just a kid who grew up to be your next door neighbor or your best friend i want to thank

my colleague councilman espinoza for picking up the gauntlet laid down at one of our public comment sessions and putting through a bill that outlawed bump stocks and reduced our allowable size for high capacity magazines but there is so much

much more that that must be done we watch with interest to see how the courts will assess boulder's recent efforts to eliminate assault weapons in their community but at the same time we're very aware that the scourge of gun violence goes far d

cheaper than guns alone we must finally make a sea change commitment to mental health care we must address the winding income gap and the attendant frustration and hopelessness that shows a few having so much and so many having so little our children

are becoming more and more frightened with every passing week less and less sure that they are safe in their schools i met last week with dps security chief mike eaton to get an idea about what our public school district is doing to protect our kids he spoke at great length about what the def

utrecht is doing as far as infrastructure and process and systems and and partnership with the denver police department to change the paradigm but security can only do so much to control the deranged again we must do a better job of healing the sick re

repairing the damage

much of what this council might want to do

it is preempted by state law

whereas i've said before we can't even create a database of gun owners

it's against the law

i am prepared to join with my colleagues mayor hancock governor hickenlooper and our state legislators to again change that paradigm so that we might create a new denver a new colorado where kids get in full night of peaceful rest knowing that the worst that might happen to them

the next day at school is a pop quiz that they weren't expecting thank you mr president

wow thank you thank you councilman councilwoman arteaga

i first want to thank councilman cashier for bringing this forward in for that very thorough overview of what has become too much of a norm in this country we cannot accept this being the norm we have to stand

and keep guns out of the hands of our children and out of the hands of criminals

this is just we should not have to be doing this kind of proclamation

it's time across this country that we all stand up and make our voices heard loud and clear on behalf of our children on behalf of our communities that this is not acceptable

not long ago one of my granddaughters was at school and they they

had to shelter in place because there was somebody in the neighborhood not far from here very close to downtown

their school is is very close to downtown where

you know this person had a gun and said they wanted to make sure all the students were safe kids should feel comfortable and they should be safe going to school going to the movies going to any public place where they don't have to fear for their lives

because we had too many guns on the streets in this country councilman cashman thank you for bringing this

thank you councilman arteaga council espinoza

thank you and cashman for not only bringing this forward but the comments you just made tonight you can probably hear my voice how moved i am by by what you shared

this is in context with the conversation ahead on on on friday

anyway the the second amendment starts with four words a well regulated militia regulated being the third work in the second amendment and if you have a well regulated militia mean we do what we have is not a well regulated militia when you have this many members of that

that militia the people using that part of the the of this provision going off and killing people indiscriminately you have a problem in your militia

and so that's where the well regulated part needs to come in to effect

and what's interesting is then the next line mean the next part of that first sentence is being necessary to the security of a free strait free state if you have to have checkpoints at churches and schools and the recommendations a single entry into that location that's not

not a free state that is that is everything that we fought multiple wars against so there is just a very very serious disconnect like logging onto the right the right of people to bear keep and bear arms if you're not doing the first two things having a well regular

hated militia and in maintaining a free state the security of a free state that those guns are not performing the function that they are that that thinking is passe it is old and i am glad that on friday i got to to it to be part of a panel held by

skinner students lily rachel and ada

let it let to a panel of very very capable panel where we learned about what this city in this state is doing

and so the good news is is that we're making progress on focusing on wellbeing i think if we there's a lot that's wrong in america

that we can fix and there's examples in our own past there's examples worldwide on how we can do a better america and be a more perfect union and so we're moving towards it if we can work on the wellbeing of the individual cover their health cover their education make sure that they have all the things that they

they need so that they're not reaching that point it probably won't matter how many guns you have but the good news is is that generation those middle schoolers the ones right before the parkland high school students they're getting it they're understanding that there's a very big disconnect between a very very very vocal

and and well funded minority in this country

gloaming behind a the the fourth phrase and in the second amendment and skipping over the other two crucial portions and they are going to be the the change agents and so the combination let's work on the well-being let's work on the individuals let's work on the community culture and environment that schools are

that our society is while this new and nurture a new generation that actually sees of a free and secure america as being one that's open and tolerant and caring for one another so i mean that is what's what what we've done in the past clearly isn't working and the really frustrating thing is is that

is that is is is depressing as it is hearing about school shootings over and over and over again and the the the the i don't know what the total number of middle schools and high schools that were open and closed on that day that didn't experience that and it's an overwhelming large number

the kids that are going to school today are fearful and i could not shake that out of in that room i just couldn't i couldn't imagine it wasn't something that i went through in high school it never occurred to me that we needed to have

the school resource officer and metal detectors and i went to school in colorado but there were two members of that board that had experienced a gun violence in colorado high schools and so it's it's a thing that is affecting them and until we we we

we do the heavy lifting ourselves nothing's going to get done and until these guys get in charge and great thankfully for us there that's in my lifetime and i'm looking forward to thanks

right councilman can each thank you mister president there's little i can add to the eloquent where it says the sponsor of this councilman cashman but where there's a gap i liked it kind of jumped and witches i think it's really important to focus on the the school shootings because they have been such a visible symptom of the disease

have guns in our country but they aren't the only place where moms are losing kids and i just have to acknowledge the moms in our city who lose kids everyday and individual shootings and homicides and many many women in our city lose their lives at the hands of their intimate partners at the other end of a gun and so

i worry a little bit that too much of the gun debate has moved to this realm of mass shooting and in some ways has has changed the debate where where whereas in talking about mental illness and i think you know it is important to bring more attention to mental illness and treatment but if we did our raising of hands of who here hasn't

mental illness or someone in their close family who suffers for one i think many of our hands would go up and so i think that i am not comfortable with the way the national debate has taken the focus away from guns and tried to put it on mental illness as if that is the the the the lethal element here it's certainly an ally

i meant where we miss warning signs where we miss opportunities intervene every piece of those systems should be fixed but that does not replace the need to regulate guns in common sense ways to save lives and not just for mass shootings but for the many individuals more more individuals than councilman cashman read

more mothers and and more lost kids who lose lose their lives in other types of gun violence so i think it's just important that those families and those folks be recognized i don't have a list of their names but i'm worn for them as well and for them to we need to keep this debate focused on the regulatory side again mental health is empty

portant we need to talk about it but not as a substitute for controlling the lethality of guns thank you all right thank you councilman lopez

thank you mr president much to add except to want to transmit cash it those are very very well written proclamation and your comments were right on point

one

when i think of when you're

speaking i was just thinking of a conversation i had with my daughter

who is ten years old

goes to school and dps and i was just reflecting on

we were talking about tornado safety

you know if a tornado hit you go to a hallway and you do your drills the drills that i had one on in elementary school

she taught me something completely different

she says while we do the shelter in place

lockdown drills and lockdown drills she says well you have to stay away from the windows and we gotta go hide when we gotta be quiet and i have a special job as i was your job me how she says i have to make sure that the closet i have to i'm the one that has to go run

on and make sure that the closet door is open so that the classroom door does not open she goes it's the real close together and it locks so nobody can come in baba

i never think to myself man

just one of those drills with skills it's scaring the hell out of me as a kid

imagine

i mean i just imagined myself as as an elementary school in her same elementary school by the way

and just being scared for my life i mean tornado drills are bad as it is hiding under the under the desks and you know for some for some folks that are on the west coast that's scary enough as it is imagine those drills for lockdowns and

and imagine their reality twenty years from now

their d sensitivity

the

ptsd is just doing that and how that would affect our future or kids or society

so i think about that then i then i saw

an update on cnn there was a number that said there have been twenty two hundred and eighty eight school shootings since two thousand and nine which was fifty seven times more than the other six g seven countries combined

it's going to take a heck of a lot more and it's becoming cliche than just passing the buck to hopes and prayers and everybody's asking for action it's going to take a culture change a shift in our culture

when we go to the flea market

while there are for boys to play with and the market erected the boys are the little plastic guns olympics teens not even cowboy pea shooters man these are m sixteens at the at the market you go into any one of these malls in the area and you can buy guns and it's not necessarily the the ones that are real bullets but they have their airsoft and

there are replicas right

so you just think about that and think about our culture there's so many different ways that we can change and make these shifts or encourages encourage other people to make these shifts and you know there are these cultural psyche that that that we create for our society and it's something that we can do you don't have to wait

on congress to do it or we don't have to wait on government whether it be local or state to do it right we can encourage with our dollars and if i might just add something

i think about growing up in the nineties

and

having guns pointed at you or being threatened with weapons because you add a different color on

those of us who grew up in the nineties

just knew how tough that was it was not uncommon to have a weapon in somebody's locker or to have shootings outside i mean we got chased around by the vg vs outside of west high school with guns

that culture has to shift and we can't wait for it to be a school shooting and we can't just talk about it in school shootings as an everyday thing that we have to change so

and i dunno maybe this is something that we can look into i hate i never thought i would

i come to this point or even say this publicly but

i think it's time to start looking at metal detectors in our schools if that's if it means saving people's lives are just folks my friends that have all the way all across the country that they look at me weird because my high school didn't have a metal detector it

so

the ten steps that i wish we didn't have to cross but i think we've passed that threshold a long time ago so thank you councilman cashman for for bringing this topic up again i'm glad that we're not just the kind of like a one and done or you know we just have one proclamation or one action that we forget about it i'm glad that you brought this

forward again thank you

yeah thank you councilman lopez and thank you councilman cashman for bringing this for a lot to think about here and it has been moved in second in madam secretary roll-call cashman i can eat lopez i knew ortega sussman black

claire espinosa flynn i gilmore i miss president i please was the loneliness results twelve ice twelve eyes five ninety four has been adopted counseling cash is there anybody you'd like to bring up yes mr president i'd like to bring up josie brady representing the colorado coalition

guns gun violence

and today i gratefully accept that proclamation from councilman cashman on behalf of the colorado coalition against gun violence when i was thirteen months old columbine happened thirteen people lost their lives that day when i was nine years old i was at city park jazz and i fled for my life

my friends and i had to run as a shooting broke out between two rival gang members five years later officers officer selena hollis was killed at that same event several weeks after she was killed the aurora theater shooting happened where twelve lives were taken the next year i was sent home early from i attended east high school and i

sent home early classes were cancelled that day because there were threats against our school that shooting would happen

and just a few weeks ago i was working with my friends at regis university where i now attend and we were working out homework in a classroom and we learned that two shooters ran onto our campus from fiftieth in federal and we had to barricade the doors with our legs and we didn't know what to do let's just say i didn't get my homework done that night

what do these all have in common well these are things that have happened in my life but i'm not alone i have not felt safe in my schools in my parks at my movie theaters or in my neighborhood fear has consumed me and many others in my generation across the country as of five days ago nine hundred forty three young people under

the age of eighteen have been killed due to gun violence in two thousand and eighteen that's under the age of eighteen not even my age group that number does not include the people that have been killed for many years ever since nineteen seventy when the arkansas shooting happened this number includes though seventeen year old ty

ty martinez who shot and killed in march at west colfax and lol i initially took this fear and turned it into action i started a group at east high school to bring in young people to start talking about the issue and what to do about it i got involved in the national level that generation progress to organize young people across the country and as four years have passed our leaders have done things

but it's not been enough we have seen how young people are fed up the parents like the moms and dads here today which i would like everyone if you are here working on this issue currently if you could please stand and recognize you

the march for our lives was just the beginning the walkouts were just the beginning this proclamation is the next step next we need solutions to reduce the disapprobation of gun violence deaths of young people and especially young people of color that are not recognized we should all feel safe in

our neighborhoods and our schools and thank you to councilman cashman and two the count city council today for sponsoring for you for sponsoring this proclamation for everyone for voting yes on this this population is not the end though we all have to keep showing up and working to reduce gun violence we have to we have to for everyone who has lost their sons daughters boy

federation and do pass as amended

alright it has been moved and seconded public hearing for three two two three three twenty three is now open may we have the staff report sarah

good evening i'm sarah with cpd here to present the staff report for the two thousand and eighteen text amendment bundle

so as you may be familiar with our bundles of the past and the texts memory bundle is part of our effort to keep the zoning code modern clear user friendly and updated and for us to be able to respond to requests for changes to the zoning code so city staff periodically reviews the code and prayer

critize his updates in response to customer and community feedback industry changes and other factors and we we try to do these bundles of texas moments roughly annually so the most previous bundle was adopted last spring in april of two thousand and seventeen

so the bundle is intended to implement several of the comprehensive two thousand plan goals to ensure that the zoning code is flexible and accommodates the current and future land use needs and it encourages quality infill development that is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and establishes development standards that

encourage positive change in diversity while protecting character and identifying community design and development issues and target specific concerns with appropriate controls and incentives so the bundle allows us to respond to these types of requests as we as we get them and try to keep the zoning code updated in an annual fashion

so the process so far we started the scoping of this text him i met last summer and really research and drafted throughout the summer and fall and then started some targeted stakeholder outreach in late two thousand and seventeen early two thousand and eighteen so even before a public review draft

was available we did want to start the conversation with stakeholders who may be impacted by some of the changes so that we could have the conversation get the feedback make any changes that were necessary as a result of that conversation we also presented to the i n c zoning and planning committee for an info item in late january

then on february twelfth was when we released the full public red line and included the full text of the changes and a summary and more plain english since these bundles tend to be a little difficult to wrap your heads around this one in particular includes over eighty items that was on our tex

the amendment list and then when that was released there was also notice sent to all our nose and council members as well we did offer text amendment briefings to all council members during this time on february twenty first we had an info item at planning board and then we also had

an info item at luci on march sixth

and then march sixteenth we had our planning board hearing

so for planning board and for city council we have six letters of comment for the bundle and one was in support of our mess and form changes that are proposed as part of the mixed use two story districts one was in opposition to those same changes saying that they were inappropriate to restrict

commercial properties one was asking for restrictions on the location of many storage facilities particularly close to downtown which is a topic that this bundle is addressing

was commenting on the proposed step back that is part of the two and a half story building forms with low sloped roofs and this was a competent planning board as well generally some concerns with the number we were proposing the step-back to be addressed at

one with generally various comments about all of the changes and then an additional letter that was submitted at planning board from the vision zero coalition in support of the proposed drive through restrictions

at planning board planning board voted seven to one to recommend approval with the following conditions the first condition was that the draft continued to be edited for clarity and then the next the conditions two and three where staff recommended conditions sos number two was that we clarify the applicability of some of the lightings

standard changes and to remove changes to the maximum height for all fixtures so these were some things that were in the early drafts as part of the the lighting changes that as we talked more through them with our internal departments particularly development services some concerns were brought about about how we might implement some of those and

in terms of inspections and that sort of thing so we clarified the applicability of what types of projects would be subject to these new changes

number three was that saffron moves changes to the site interior setbacks for the amex mm two x districts when adjacent to protect the district so those of you who were on lydian had individual briefings may remember that one of the changes we are proposing is to increase the rear setback for our mx two x districts and as part of

that we also made a slight change to the side interior setback and we realized that that was actually inconsistent with the intent of what we were proposing to do so we are leaving the side interior sat back as in the code currently but still proposing the increased rear setback

and the number four was a condition that planning board added and it was a result of a lot of conversation about the comment whether the step back for the two and a half story districts was appropriate to be applied at twenty five feet or if there was a different number so planning board added the condition that staff further examining consider in future chase

changes regarding possible unintended consequences of urban house ten footstep back about twenty five feet and possible unintended consequences of low sloped roof definition and complexity of compound roof slopes so the one vote of opposition from planning board was to do the fact that the planning board member did not agree with adding the fourth condition it was

not that he disagreed with the content of the bundle and so we had three speakers at planning board to internally from the city one from denver environmental health and one from the vision zero coalition both speaking in support of the drive through restrictions and how they relate to pedestrian safety and actually asking for

for them to be expanded in the future and then the the member that also wrote the letter that is included in your packet spoke about the concerns with the low-slope roof definition and the if the step back was proposed at the correct number and as you'll see in your packet he wrote a follow up letter after planning board that conceded that the the twenty five

the foot was was an appropriate number to apply the step back at

after planning board city council had the loony committee on april tenth which was a consent agenda item on first reading was the nineteenth and we are at our public hearing tonight just a reminder that the bundle is proposed to have a roughly six month grace period for projects that have been submitted before the effective

date to align with the end of the slot homes grace period which is why i say roughly six months since slot home since adopted about two weeks ago and we wanted to align the end of the grace period with their grace period so that our development services staff didn't have to juggle multiple deadlines and the reason for the grace period is similar to slot homes in that

there would be some pretty significant impacts to projects that have already put a lot of time and effort and investment into submittals and we wanted to give them some time to finish up

so because of the process that we've had so far and the fact that we had individual council briefings and we did have an info item for the loot committee i'm not going to go into the details of all eighty items that are proposed as part of the bundle those are detailed in your packet but what i am going to do tonight is i'm going to go through some of the changes that have a

occurred since you would have heard about it at a briefing or lucci

so we continued to correct any errors in translations continue to improve graphics cross references clarification all of those things that the bundle is great for related to the mini storage and drive through restrictions in sms and downtown zone districts and near rail stations so this is not so

one thing that has changed so we did decide to continue to propose that many storage be not allowed within a quarter mile of rail unless you're in an industrial zone district and four drive throughs within a quarter mile of rail to not be allowed unless you're in a suburbans one district with some additional restrictions just wanted to highlight this bill

because this topic by far has gotten the most conversation out of anything in the bundle and we've heard a lot of this is great it should go further we should apply it to more areas of the city but we've also heard some this might be a little bit of an overstep we want to make sure that we're supporting our density and our small units and giving them pay

places to store their stuff and so we really think that the proposal as is in the bundle is a really good first step for treating these we have heard a lot that we'd like that there are people who would like to see this potentially expanded to transit corridors or all corridors are all mixed use zoning which is a really large imp

fact on the city transit corridors the reason that we didn't include them as part of this is because there's there's a lot less policy surrounding our transit corridors right now there's a lot of planning going on particularly with the denver moves plan so as as that infrastructure fills and and as planning and policy kind of is solidified around those areas i think

there's definitely room to consider something further but for now we are remaining with the rail station quarter mile buffer and the downtown zone district changes

as i mentioned earlier we are still proposing to increase the rear setback in r m s and m x two x districts when there are adjacent to protect the district's annual reminder the reason for this is because the zone districts are intended to be embedded in residential areas surrounded by urban houses and duplexes that they really should refer

the fact that character that they're intended to be placed in and not be allowed to build to the zero lot line and have a really large hulking structure and so as i said there was just a minor change that was proposed in addition to the rear setback for the site interior setback we had proposed to increase that but then we when we looked at it again we realized that that was

actually inconsistent with the urban how standards which is what we were basing it off of so we decided to keep that that standard at five feet

and then some more of the the little shifts that we've done we are still adding some standards to parking lot lighting we're adding maximum

illumination levels for certain uses were met adding uniformity ratios for safety and some of the things that we have changed a little bit since we talked with you earlier was some additional clarification on what projects would be applicable to these changes so basically that projects that are submitted from here on out will be required to

comply with these and not necessarily projects that are already built because that would be really difficult for our inspections to enforce and then we had also proposed a mounting height limitation for fixtures on there is already mounting height limitation for free standing lights in the zoning code and we were proposing to apply that to all

all lights but we realize that that could have some unintended consequences it would prevent someone from having a patio light on their third floor apartment that sort of thing so that's something that we'd like to look at a little further this is an additional topic that we've had a lot of conversation about through this bundle process and again this is kind of a first step for some lighting changes to our code

code our code doesn't have a lot of lighting standards right now so we want to kind of start with the worst of it and continue to evaluate that through future bundle changes and such

and then for the two and a half story forms at the low sloped roof we are proposing a ten foot step back above twenty five feet to essentially break up the mass of a building from the street so you probably are aware that are two and a half story building form can result in something that really appears to be three

stories which is really out of context with a lot of what's built in the neighborhoods so this step back above twenty five feet is intended to make the building appear to be more consistent with generally the two stories that it's it's built around and this is what planning board had a lot of discussion about based on mister farley's comment asking whether

the twenty five feet was the right standard and if there are other things that we hadn't considered as part of this so we did study that number more and we did come to the conclusion that twenty five feet is the appropriate height to apply to step back at and we also got the follow up letter from mr varley agreeing but we did actually use the unintended consequences a portion

of the planning board recommendation to consider and add the addition of an administrative adjustment for historic structures for this step back and so in our code we already have allowed administrative adjustments for bulk and height for historic structures and since this is a bulk related item

it was brought to our attention by the curtis park neighborhood that this could have some pretty large effects on the historic character by requiring the step back and so because in historic districts there is an additional level of review there's the design standards there's ltd rb or lpc that has to make these decisions

we were comfortable adding an administrative adjustment that would allow with the approval of the landmark commission to get out of this step back in historic districts or historic structures

so moving on to the criteria that we use to address text moments on the first is consistency with the city's adopted plans and policies the first is comprehensive plan two thousand which i went over a little earlier how the reason the bundle is consistent with adopt a comp plan including requiring infill development to be consistent we've done a lot in this

bundle about consistent infill and bulk and mass and then blueprint denver we have language in there that says amendments are recommended to implement adopted plans and improve compatibility with existing plans as well as revised standards to make existing zone districts more compatible which is what a lot of these mass inform changes are doing

and it furthers the public health safety and general welfare by providing clarity and predictability by facilitating planned and desired private enterprise and redevelopment and it continues to implement adopted plans through regulatory changes

and it results in regulations that are uniform on the amendments regulations are uniform in their application to buildings and land uses within each zone districts citywide and it improves greater consistency in zoning regulations and removes conflicting provisions which improves our ability to administer and enforce the code uniformly

so with that iowa staff does recommend that the city council approve the text moment twenty eighteen bundle i am happy to answer any questions and talk about any of the topics in the bundle especially since we didn't go into the details in the staff report thanks great thank you sir alright we have three speakers this evening i'm gonna ask them to come to the f

front we have joe noble jesse paris and chairman si cu joe europe first three minutes

good evening council my name is joel noble a little bit to seven zero five stout street first i just want to say these these bundles are one of my favorite things this is owning geek because i get exposed to so many of the things that ended up needing tweaked whether hear about it through neighborhood organizations or comes through planning board or here

about something go through going through the board of adjustment for zoning appeals that it's it's always great when it's some time later it takes a little bit of time you see a fixed propose that's been studied and carefully considered and you say oh that's great i knew that didn't work right i was carrying that around with me and now i know it's getting solved

john hayden prisoners of curtis park neighbors sent a letter to council copying cpd last week thanking cpd for the work on one piece here which is a change to the administrative adjustment table and he asked that i speak on on behalf of curtis park neighbors tonight as an advisory board member just conveying or thanks

curtis park and perhaps other historic neighborhoods from the same era tend to be tend to have houses that are narrow and tall and this new upper storey step back for low sloped roofs like italian eight structures would require them would actually prevent them from being as tall as they normally are

or when we have infill in our neighborhood that infill should fit in if if a house is built strictly to the zoning code it would look quite small compared to the historic context today we depend entirely on administrative adjustment which is a great little escape clause in the zoning code that says

the zoning administrator may within certain limits allow some dimensions to be exceeded or modified in order to fit the context better if it's beyond that limited allowance that needs to go for variance but within within bounds and that works very very well we go through landmark review because they're a landmark district and then whatever

or administrative adjustments are needed i have never been denied this new measurement was not available for administrative adjustment so that that meant that any infill housing in curtis park that is as tall as our normal housing is or is our context i would have to go all the way for a variance which isn't

expensive link the and uncertain process and when when we made that case to cpd they knew exactly what we were talking about they never react quickly they want to always want to go away study came back within a few days and said okay this narrow allowance on the administrative adjustment table where you're in a landmark district and landmark

irc has reviewed it is the minimum necessary to to meet your concerns and in fact it is so thank you to sarah and thank you to kyle dalton and jennifer beto

we're thrilled to see this go forward alright thank you mr noble jesse paris you're up three minutes

good evening members of council when i'm jesse pairs my twenty eight forty two joseph finish street and brooks district nine

my question is i'm neither for i'm neither for nor against this i just need clarification on what is a protected district is that the same thing as a historical districts

what is urban how standards and is this in any way going to increase the already gentrification that is going on in the curtis park neighborhood

it seems like you guys will just give them leeway to gentrification and historically black and brown communities i just need clarification that this build and bundle is not going to do

facilitate that further thank you

alright thank you chairman sekou

six minutes

okay here we go my insurance a coup

to organize a black social movements social change agency voice for the poor working poor

homeless senior citizens and or youth

this bundling

to pool all of these seemingly minor pieces

that are connected to each other

is a

good idea on this

anytime you can find common ground with eighty different minor entities and combined them into one big thing

is part of administration

and of course a lot of thought meetings and explanations that we don't have to go through here and just bought it today because the work has been done by planet

but now let's look at pulling the layers back

of the onion to get to the core about what is really driving

and what are the values behind this thing that allows us to miss fours for treats we've got the treason

and it's a big thing what's really driving this thing was really trying

and that becomes the question for the people because when you do this bundling thing when you combine all of these things that you do early and images into one vote and then that one vote there are hundreds of millions of dollars gone

taxpayers' money

watching this on tv because it means we'll organize at a time with rush hour traffic jack that can come down here so they get it after the fact

and so one of the things we do with this process is to allow it to become educational process for the people who can be at the meeting for further review

understanding that there's a timeframe that folks got thirty sixty days whatever that is to actually implement a change

now for vulnerable communities that's not possible because the people are caught up especially the folks that i represent into day to day survival

how am i going to pay my rent what am i gonna do about my kids going to school hungry

how am i going to do this thing when the food bank is gone and i eat transportation crazy i don't have that amount of money to ride the bus so i gotta figure out moscow to i can walk to where i got to go

let's see caught up in that minutia

we don't have time to look at the overview about hey man what are they planning for you now that's going to impact your future

and then the outreach doesn't include the future for education processes and to gain them into a better position of being great citizens added in a great city you had no outreach

two high school's student comes great way to educate him about what we can really do to you so the outreach has to be expanded into student government assistance and university ecologist who are preparing themselves to be a part of this not in it because you a it to our nose and due to do but the people

in the future the you are not included in the outreach so why not invite them to the meeting or had the meeting at a high school where they're at how about a meeting two on a college campus where they're at see

and now we're talking about expanding democracy and getting more folks involved in the participation of the future because it's the students and the youth which are the future right now and their voices need to be done right now so they understand what is light industrial

has any

as you blow past it on the reading they don't know about none of that and change it from this to that they don't even have a bill even know what this is right now but we miss a golden opportunity to prepare the future leadership to our outrage that can be expanded

sea salt the juice has to be included in this thing because they're the ones who are going to be sitting up here because at one point always youth

what you learn about this

and you're adult how about if you knew this now what kind of adult citizens would that be outstanding

so in this process of having team work to make the dream work the dream is about now and it's about the future and is about children is about increasing this empty chamber full of kids who want to come down here and learn how to do this thing

on the taxpayers' dollars because they're the taxpayers that are going to be paying for the future things that are happening at least we can do is educate them now in this day so thank you

thank you very much this concludes our three speakers for this evening are there any questions by members of council

councilman ortega

thank you mr president i do have a question about the two and a half story step back and what i'm trying to understand is if that is only applicable to the residential zones and is it specific to historic districts

or is it help just helped me understand how broadly that is applied share so it is applicable to all of our two and a half storey residential building forms and generally in our mixed use districts we don't have the two and a half story building forms because the height limits are higher and so it's going to be

your urban house your duplex your two and a half story rowhouse across sport okay so where the code formerly allowed like half of a third story does this remove that helped me understand what that

so i'll clarify what the half story is because it's not really a half story essentially what it is is it's a third story that's allowed to be no greater than seventy five percent of the floor below it and what that was intended to do i may have slide here

so this slide this image on this slide on the top is from the zoning code and it was really what the half story was intended to do when you have the traditional house with the sloped roof and it's two stories you have that space under the sloped roof that's technically would be considered a third

story and we wanted to allow it to be used as livable space so we called that a half story when it's really seventy five percent of the floor below it's a third story and you can see that this is a photo example of infill that has used that and you can see it's generally pretty in scale with surrounding but essentially what's been

happening is people take that allowance and when you use a flat roofed form or as we're redefining in the bundle low slope and you push it to the front of the building it really looks like a full three stories and you can see it towering over the the surrounding infill development and to what this is intended to do

do is to push back that third story we haven't made any changes to the allowance of how much of it but it's possible that there will be less allow for allowed flour area if they can't get that full seventy five percent after having to to step it back ten feet from the front of the building okay that's very helpful thank you

i have no further questions thank you councilwoman against one espinoza

do you want to take a stab at explaining what a protected district is chirp and so a protected district is essentially in practice a low scale residential district we have a definition in the code it's got a list of oliver's one districts that are considered protected districts it's all of our single unit districts oliver

two unit districts i think all of our own house districts and one multi unit district the m u two and a half and what that means is when you have a mixed use zone district adjacent to something that's considered a protected district things that are built on that lot have to comply with additional

standards usually it's additional setbacks or additional bulk playing that sort of thing to protect the character of the low scale residential that it's adjacent to

but

the disc we're only talking about the mapped district the the the the physical map district it doesn't it's it doesn't matter whether or not the building is a low scale residential building that's correct

alright hope that helps thanks thank you no further questions okay thank you seeing no other questions this concludes the public hearing of

three twenty three comments by maria's account so doctor says thank you mr president i just want to thank the cpd and the planning board for the work that you did on this bundle and while it is a lot of things that really

dives into things that we have had some concerns about that we hear about it committee they will hear about some neighbors who are worried about construction going on next door thanks for the explanation of the two point five because i too was thinking he's really seventy five percent of the top but if they can't get the ten foot setback it may not be so

ninety five percent of the top of it right ok and also for in you know increasing the setbacks but but specially for the storage units many stores and i think i have to thank my fellow councilwoman kendra black who also brought this forwards that this is a very good move i think to help us

with getting activation around areas of transit and mainstreet thank you

alright thank you dr sussman counsel in black want to thank sarah you are really great and with the t o d limiting the storage and the drive throughs i wanted to go a little further but i acknowledge it's a good first step and i appreciate you reaching out to the storage unit as well

association we met with them and they were okay with it and the drive through people never got back to us so i really appreciate it my district has five light rail stations and a lot of storage facilities and we don't want to have anywhere near our light rail station so thank you very much

alright thank you councilman black espinosa becomes one of smoke

is there a drive through association

i also wanted to thank you again sarah and staff or another text amendment it's always nice to see these changes i don't think i geek out as much as joel does but it is fun to see incremental change to our zoning code and the one thing that i you made it very clear that you're you're you're cognizant

there might be unintended consequences and you're sort of recognizing that there's still the ability for things you haven't considered come about and i think in in an earlier presentation that sort of opined where i saw the sort of something breaking down and the so i'm going to go back to something i said i think two or three meter

months ago which is

is if staff is is seen that

speak up and let the zoning administrator know that there is this repeated incidents happening that may not warrant a you may rise to an occasion where you're not following the usual text amendment but then bringing it to grab you can even having him move forward with a quick change

it it'll still be a public process we will still have the ability to discuss it but let's not wait for repeated sort of habitual pattern to form and and get so deliberative in if we are already recognizing that one change we've made has unintended consequences that could be addressed maybe by coupling

warm standard with a use exception or something like that you know so that's all just wanted to make sure that i'm probably going to keep hitting that point time and time again now because it's sort of my one thing is how do we more rapidly address things that go south when when we know better so that's it thanks

alright thank you thank you all thank you cpd for for putting this forward and you know i think you guys are are starting to adjust and i'm in issues that we're seeing all over the city and really appreciate that everyone does low speed and we want this to be faster but at the same time

i

i don't want to say but we want it faster we want more speed let's just leave a period there i will also say that i recognize the macro changes that were happening about this the city and these until ten o'clock consequences have happened in my district they've happened in other districts and and i understand those are

sometimes irreversible and so i appreciate it but as long as we can figure out how to churn a little faster on some of these things it will be very helpful to folks you see up here or on the front front lines of dealing with a lot of our yet land use issues and we're getting we have a lot of idea

does and so do we want to see those things move but thank you for your heart work and notes very deliberative we appreciate it with that madam secretary it's been moved and seconded roll call black

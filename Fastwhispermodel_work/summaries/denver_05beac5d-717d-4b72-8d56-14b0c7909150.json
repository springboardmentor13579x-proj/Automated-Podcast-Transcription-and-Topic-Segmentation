All right thank you Jesse that concludes our speakers questions from members of\ncouncil on council bill 1027 and or council bill 1028 I'll give it another moment for any\nhands raised all right see no questions of members of council the public hearing is closed\ncomments by members of council on council bill 1027 and or council bill 1028 councilman's\nand of all. Thank you madam president so thank you all it's an honor to be here with for\nyou today with this application as it's been discussed this is the first time an entire\nneighborhood has been rezoned to allow self-accessory rallying units and honestly I\nwouldn't be here today with all of you if it wasn't for the residents of chubby park they\ncame together and approached me before I was even sworn into office to talk about how we\ncould get this done and one of the things that we found out early on is you're voting on\ntwo things you're creating a new map a map you're creating a new zone district because on\nthe east side of t-home the parcels are so small that there was not actually a zone\ndistrict that would allow accessory dwelling units so I had to create I had to slow the\nprocess down a little bit and work with community planning and development and create\nequity throughout the whole entire neighborhood so the whole entire neighborhood would be\nable to allow it have the opportunity to have accessory dwelling units. I feel like a lot\nof times when we're talking about rezoning and we're talking about land use we use\nterminology that's not very accessible and those in the city and county of Denver or those\nof us on city council we understand it because we have lots of meetings with planners who\nexplain it and so I feel like it's my job to be able to explain it to everybody who would\nbe impacted by these rezoning."

            "text": "We had just a tremendously diverse slate of candidates again I think this goes to this\nissue of who who is who is electing these candidates so now you are as a candidate you\nhave one election it's more about turnout it is about reaching as many voters as possible\nit's about talking to everyone that you can even those who have said someone else is my\nfirst choice and we heard candidates say that they felt more comfortable coming into the\nrace even if they weren't sure how viable they were in the beginning so we ended up with\nagain just a very diverse slate of candidates these are people who were elected the first\ntwo transgender council members were elected in the first Somali American and Latina\ncouncil members were reelected in this election and for Minneapolis this is a big change\nand again this is not fully reflecting the whole slate of candidates who are running all\nright let's see I'm going to skip that okay so I wanted to get to this example from the\nmayor's race so here we have let's see one two three four five so we have essentially what\nI talked about were these top five my year old candidates and then this was other so again\nthis was kind of an interesting race we have an incumbent who was running for your\nelection and she did not win her race two years four years ago when we had a mayoral\nelection we had what I think is had been more traditional than what I had seen which is\nthat you had like a couple of candidates just sort of rise above the pack and kind of hold\non to that so it felt even though like there were more candidates it felt like there were\ntwo main candidates that was not the feel in Minneapolis this year you saw I'm gonna go\nthrough here so here they first eliminated the other candidates and we knew who won the\nmayor's race we had an inclination of who might win the day of the election and we had\nfinal confirmed results for the mayor's race by the early afternoon of the next day so\nthose ballots moved to voter second choices um round two round three Nakema Levy pounds is\neliminated she was the African-American woman who was featured in the early video she was\na candidate I'll just say in the last elections report that I saw she raised only $40,000\nso I just want to say this is like an election where someone like that who I will say was\nsomeone who had a lot of popular following um was able to come out um in the top five\ncandidates in a competitive uh race all this in she had a baby uh on the campaign trail um\nyes um Tom Hoke is eliminated I'll just want to mention him because he was a candidate who\nraised the most money um he spent a lot of his own personal fortune um he raised about\n$750,000 that he spent on the race um so he was gone next I'll just flip through this\nbecause I will say on our elections website which you can see at vote.miniapolismn.gov\nthey have a very interesting graphic that shows how people's votes uh went once they were\neliminated and so you might just want to take a look at that Betsy Hodges is eliminated\nshe was the incumbent mayor her um and then we had whoops then we had a winner with 57% of\nuh of counted ballots or continuing ballots all right this is one other race just to kind\nof take a look at because there's this kind of shorter story to tell here um this was a\nrace between um a 20-year incumbent and uh she had two challengers um this was a race we\nwe do do endorsing of candidates in Minneapolis nobody was endorsed in this race by the\nparty um although the challenger Philippe Cunningham was the closest um and um what ended\nup happening here was uh so there's round one um there were two challengers Stephanie\nGasca and Philippe Cunningham and in round two Gasca and then another candidate Hanson\nwere eliminated um um there um Gasca and Cunningham clearly were aligned candidates um\nthey uh and they ended up promoting a message towards the end of the campaign where they\nencouraged uh the other person's supporters to please rank them as their second choice so\nthere was an alignment that that happened there and in the end even though Barb Johnson\nwas first in the early round um Philippe Cunningham received the lion share of these other\nvotes this was a big story he was um uh he was a surprise candidate to win that race and\nthis is just another graphic of that but she she was not successful the incumbent in\nattracting enough second choice votes to put her over the edge and this is uh the winner\num Philippe Cunningham um I think I've taken up quite a bit of time here but I will just\nsay um that I feel sad that we weren't able to have our elections uh our city clerk here\nCasey Carl um he had to deal with a recount in one of our races and he's preparing for you\nknow a new mayor and a bunch of new council members um but uh people should feel free to\nreach out um to Casey Carl and the city of Minneapolis he has been a great advocate of how\nto institute this elections method uh well with integrity our elections team has won some\nnational awards and also just to this point of engagement with voters um I feel like our\nwhole elections team has continued just to be creative and how to engage with voters it's\nlike the workaround ranked choice voting has ushered in a whole new um kind of way to do\nthe work of the elections department where they now perceive that part of their work is\nabout continuously educating and engaging with voters making sure they have good\ninformation about how to fill out their ballots and all this kind of thing so um it has\nushered in um also a lot of policy changes at the city of Minneapolis on how to make\nthings work the best way that they can for voters so thanks for letting me share our story\nthank you Elizabeth one more speaker um and thanks thanks for uh sticking with us and um\nterrific set of information being presented I hope I'll um say the one part of the\nMinneapolis story that sort of jumps out to me from like looking at that mayoral result is\nthat if it had been the old system in Minneapolis and those first choices had translated\ninto votes which you don't know for sure would have happened but it would have been the\ntwo biggest spenders to white men would have advanced and been the only general election\ncandidate when turnout was much higher but they had this sort of richer debate with with\nwith more people which is analogous to what Denver where you don't have this sort of win-\na-win election you have everyone run in the first round um and someone can win in the\nfirst round but some of the systems out there wouldn't allow that um and uh say Paul also\nused ranked risk voting and they sort of interesting example of it was a big open seat\nrace for mayor people thought it would have multiple rounds um 10 candidates running and a\ncandidate ultimately won 51 percent of first choices so sort of uh sort of pushed forward\nand uh people will be the first African American mayor of St. Paul but part of the\ncoverage of it that I've really appreciated just following was that people you know felt\nthat all these candidates contributed to the dialogue about the city so even if it sort of\nlooked like a first round result where just it was normal you had sort of people be be be\nbe part of the part of the dialogue and and and part of what he as a successful candidate\nhad to learn how to be people's second choices uh so our last speaker is going to be\nConnie Schmidt and um one of the the the great uh advances for us at Fair Vote is the the\nrise of the ranked risk voting resource center which is uh run by uh former election\nofficials all with some direct experience with ranked risk voting but who can really get\ninto how to make this work and how it's working and be a resource to communities and\nstates as as they look at ranked risk voting and Connie is is an example of what a great\nasset they have she was election commissioner for Johnson County Kansas for nine years uh\nCity Clerk for Merriam Kansas for 20 years has been doing a lot of consulting uh was done\nfrom work with the uh election assistance commission and uh direct uh consulting to Casey\nCarl and some work in uh Minneapolis so Connie Thank you Rob and thank you Amber and your\ngroup for hosting this event it's a very nice turnout we're very happy to be here um as\nRob said my background is totally in um local government and service to the public and um\nthe last nine years were spent um but the best job on earth which was managing elections\nin the large county and Kansas in the Kansas City metro area since then it's been a lot of\nmy privilege to work around the country um with a lot of um initiatives in various states\nand jurisdictions um in 2011 2013 2017 in Minneapolis where I learned for the first time\nabout ranked choice voting the last couple of years it's been another privilege for me to\nbe associated with a team of people that developed the ranked choice voting resource\ncenter and I'm really excited about it because it is basically um a place where any\nelection administrator voter public official anyone candidate if you have any questions\nabout ranked choice voting you can go to this website rankedchoicevoting.org and you will\nfind all of the information that we have been able to find anywhere across the country and\nso the group that I'm working with as Rob said are retired uh and former election\nadministrators um we're very big believers in elections and sharing best practices so that\nno one has to reinvent the wheel and so um we're very proud of everything that we have\nthere it's from all the jurisdictions across the country who have um implemented ranked\nchoice voting from legislation um to any other kind of ideas that are there um part of the\nthings that it includes is a compilation of really what is ranked choice voting and so you\ncan click on various tabs on the website if you're a voter or you're a candidate or you're\nan election administrator and go to various places of information that would help you\nunderstand what it is um for example there's information on how to mark your ballot and so\nyou if you were a voter or if you were running for office there's information there um\nfrom other places across the country including samples um we have information on single-\nwinner ranked choice voter and multi-winner ranked choice voting races um the election\ntoolkit is probably one of my favorite places um we have started this year um a webinar\nseries that we've been doing online and i'll talk a little about that in a moment um we\nhave a lot of reports and presentations that we have done across the country and various\nreports that i'll um talk about we've been working with the center-fecivic design on\nusability toolkits and education toolkits um so the first thing um the webinar series and\nthose webinars are posted on that website so if you're interested in you want of them or\nall of them you can go on your own and view those um the first one we did was to introduce\neverybody to really what the ranked choice voting resource center is and how we can help\nyou and i need to add that our services are provided free of charge to any jurisdiction\nincluding travel so we are here um as a resource and to help in any way we can one webinar\nwas basically the ABCs of ranked choice voting and that was kind of a um a introduction to\nwhat is ranked choice voting and what does it mean where is it being used and then we've\ndone one on the history going back to the beginning of when ranked choice voting was first\nstarted in the united states and then the usability studies on how to design a ballot\nvoting systems capabilities including statewide how do you do this for a whole state and\ndesigning the most important which is voter education and how to present election results\nto the voters we're going to be doing more webinars um in 2018 and again those are all\ngoing to be posted on our website as we go along um the toolkit um has a variety of\nreports and presentations that our team has put together um the first one we did we called\nit the ranked choice voting compilation and you can print it out there it has active\nhyperlinks throughout the document that will take you to other best practices across the\ncountry but it's basically just that it's where has this been done before how can I see\nwhat was done before how can I get an example of how someone else that managed elections\ndid this and so that's where we'll find that the other report that I think is really good\nis implementation um of ranked choice voting with multiple voting systems you're fortunate\nin Colorado you have all one voting system statewide not every state has that convenience\nthere are many states that have um various voting vendors throughout the jurisdictions and\nthe model RCB implementation plan is one that we've just finished in September and it\nbasically takes it's a road map that we put together for any jurisdiction that was\nthinking about going to ranked choice voting as a model for managing elections from how do\nyou pass legislation what are some examples of model legislation that you can take a look\nat and print off um to how do you do voter education all the way through how do you build\nthe ballot and how do you actually provide election results on election night so there's a\nlot of really good information in um these reports and presentations um the one thing I\nwanted to um talk about very briefly is the center for civic design um we have several\nreports on the website that they have done they've been a wonderful partner to fair vote\nand the ranked choice voting resource center I think you have some handouts on your table\non the website we have the principles and guidelines report that was done by their team\nthe ballot design testing documents and I understand they're going to be here in Denver um\nlater this month to do some more for you all voter education testing documents and they\ndid go to Minneapolis and they have tested a lot of this information there and how do you\npresent election results on election night um to your voters and to the candidates so some\nof the highlights um for their design report and I have to say many of these when I was\nreading through these preparing this PowerPoint pertain to elections in general and I\nthink one of my colleagues earlier said the same thing it's really not any different than\njust managing the normal election so many of the guidelines you're going to see for the\ncenter for civic design pertain to any election that you're doing give voters the\ninformation they need to prepare to vote the only thing is when you're going to rank\nchoice voting from a normal regular election where they just vote for one person you have\nto explain the benefits and the basics of what is ranked choice voting be prepared to\nanswer their questions and be able to show voters how their ballot is actually going to be\nused in counting and tallying election results um and so one way to do that is this is a\nsample they may be on your tables I think I might have seen this one um that the center\nfor civic design put together so basically in very simple language what is ranked choice\nvoting why are we using it with as few awards as possible and you notice their icons and\ntheir words at the bottom for why it's being used save money stronger voices broader\nparticipation and so those simple words can can help a voter and the general public\nunderstand more about how to use it so that's an example that they put together another\nguideline that they presented was all of the information should be in clear and simple\nlanguage any of us that have been in elections for any period of time have this kind of\npounded into us clear and simple language is very important keep the information short and\nto the point and use everyday words so that anyone will be able to understand it in\nelections we kind of call it kindergarten words you know make it simple for everyone use\nillustrations anytime you can and use icons very sparingly to draw attention to different\ntypes of information and I have added the Minneapolis voter guide from 2017 and they're\nreally proud of it they've done a great job in Minneapolis through the years improving\neach year on the process their mission um that we kind of started in 2013 was to be the\ngold standard for ranked choice voting and I'm so proud to say that they really are um so\nthis voter guide that they did in 2017 utilize the information from the Center for Civic\ndesign on how to do this best some other information that was presented um is the how to\ndo election results on election nine and as Councilwoman Glidden pointed out the\nMinneapolis folks really set a high standard in the 2017 election if you can go to their\nwebsite and click on the mayor's race you can see this really marvelous visual of how each\nground of tabulation moved various results from one candidate to the other candidates so\nthey did a very very good job on that but use a combination of text and graphics to tell\nyour story use color and shading icons to draw attention to the various pieces it's\nimportant to include the details of where their voters expect them and use labels to\nremind the voters of the most important information and probably the most important thing\nis to use plain language if you're explaining local or state laws and terms and just very\nfew words to help people understand an example is this visual I think it's on your table\nthat the center for civic design created for us in partnership and it does show how each\nperson's unique ballot and vote for each round is being tabulated and so anytime you can\ndo any kind of a visual something like this it really helps the voters and the general\npublic and I have to say the media too because we have to educate the media on what is\nranked choice voting and how it is secure and how we are going to tabulate the results and\nso I wanted to show you a couple more examples of a way you can present this information\nso that the public can understand how the votes are being reallocated to other candidates\nas the tabulation occurs on election night everybody is used to having election results\nbefore the 10 o'clock news right well and sometimes in ranked choice voting we it takes a\nlittle bit longer as the gentleman from Alameda indicated that they still are counting\nmail ballots after the election night so the same thing is going to happen with ranked\nchoice voting it will take some time to pull all the election results together some of the\ncandidates will automatically win on election night if they receive over 51 percent of the\nvote those that don't will have to go into the rounds of tabulation this is an example of\na grid style ballot is there on your left if you're looking at it on your right is the\ncolumns and there are various ways you can design the ballot Minneapolis allows ranking of\nup to three voters three candidates I'm sorry other jurisdictions rank up to six and maybe\nup to 10 candidates that's a decision that you'll have to make but you'll notice the voter\ninstructions at the top it's really important to show a little visual for what they how to\nactually mark the ballot and it's that that's a really important piece of all of it I\nwanted to talk a little bit about educating the public again and partial to Minneapolis\nbecause that's where I've worked in ranked choice voting but they've done a really good\njob on their website and I have the address their vote manyapolismn.gov and you can go\nthere and just get all kinds of background information for how they implemented it\nstarting in 2009 they use social media I know y'all do here in Denver too Twitter Facebook\nto keep the public and the voters and the candidates informed and engaged in the entire\nprocess including on election night when we were doing tabulation the use of Twitter and\nFacebook was a really good way to keep everybody engaged they have a video I'm going to\nshow at the end on how tabulation occurs that's on their website also they do voter\noutreach handouts in various languages the one that really helped them the most I think is\nthe voter information guide mailing they mail this to every household in the city of\nMinneapolis and in ranked choice voting elections which is once every four years they\ninclude more information about what ranked choice voting is and how it works and they do a\npost-election survey they have in 2013 I believe they did it again this year surveying\nelection workers and voters and various people and the voter guide was identified as the\nmost effective tool for learning about ranked choice voting but I have to stop here and\nagain always say that our most important informant of to the voters is our poll workers in\nthe polling places on election day my colleagues in North Carolina who did a ranked choice\nvoting statewide election in a very short period of time the poll workers in the polling\nplaces are the ones that really really helped inform the voters and be sure they had the\nright information how it works educating the voters I have this handout available over\nhere if some of you would like to take that this is what Minneapolis uses it tells people\nhow not to do what not to do with the big red circle and the line drawn through it it also\nprovides information at the bottom about how to count your vote and it also says that if\nyou've made a mistake on your ballot you can please ask for another ballot and you can\nstart over so that is like a poster that's in every voting location which is also really\nreally good I wanted to give you just a couple of statistical things because I love\nstatistics and looking back on Minneapolis this is from November of 2013 I don't know they\nhave all of these numbers put together from this past November's election but I think it's\nimportant to note that the over votes in are very very less than less than 0.5% which is\nprobably comparable to any normal election that you have skipped rankings there was again\nless than 0.5% they repeated the candidates in a few and so that was an area they\nidentified by looking at these statistics that they had to do a little better job on voter\neducation and so that's the benefit of doing some of these post-election statistics and\nanalysis of how the ballots were actually voted you can see where do you need to continue\nto engage with the voters to be sure that they understand the next one relates to how many\npeople voted how many choices how many people were ranked in the mayor's race in 2013\nwhile over 75% of the voters did three choices they ranked all three choices again there\nwere a lot of candidates for mayor you'll notice if you can see this I'm not sure if\neveryone can the city council race that only had one candidate well of course only 96% of\nthe people ranked more than only but only ranked one candidate because it was only one but\nif you look down any race that had more than three or four candidates they chose at least\nthree choices when they were ranking their ballot and so these are really good statistics\nto go back and look at post-election when you can review everything after you've got the\nelection certified the last thing I want to show is the video and let me see if I can do\nthis this is on the city of Minneapolis website and it's a really nice little simple easy\nto understand visual about how we're going to count the votes on election night so I'm\ngoing to see if this were oops it didn't work so I'm going to rely on the gentleman to\nmake it go in most elections you only vote for one candidate for each office but in some\nelections voters can rank three or more candidates for each office it's called ranked\nchoice voting here's an example of how it works all of the candidates will be listed on\nthe ballot in three columns make your first choice vote in column one by filling in the\noval of the candidate you'd most like to win vote for your second choice in column two and\nmake your third choice in column three that's all there is to it now let's see how the\nvotes are counted let's say there are four candidates running for mayor Asha, Zach, Omar\nand Lucy once the polls close we count all the first choice votes first to be elected\nmayor a candidate needs more than half the votes in this example Asha has more than half\nof the votes so she's declared the winner however if no candidate gets more than half the\nvotes we start eliminating candidates and counting the next choices of those who voted in\nthis example Zach is the candidate with the smallest number of first choice votes so he is\ncut we use the second choice votes on Zach's ballots and count those voters second choices\ninstead if one of the remaining candidates now has more than half of the total votes that\ncandidate is declared the winner if not the next lowest candidate Lucy is eliminated her\nvotes are now counted for the next choice on the ballot some of Lucy's votes went to Zach\nwho was already eliminated so those new votes for Zach instead count for those voters\nthird choice candidate we are now down to two candidates and Omar clearly has more than\nhalf of the votes that makes him the winner that's how ranked choice voting works for more\ninformation on ranked choice voting visit our website okay thank you all right thank you\nConnie so I think we're actually going to try to get a hands-on experience next so maybe\nAmber will introduce us to that opportunity okay so we've got a couple of ways that we can\ntest this out first you have some paper ballots that should be on your table we also have\nthe tablets that are in the back of the room against the far wall once we collect\neverything we will count in the in the tabulation room and bring the results out and show\nwhat those look like on the screen I think what I'll do is I'm going to kick off with one\nquestion that I have just given Denver and the jurisdiction that we have here in the city\nand county of Denver and the question I have is actually for Dave McDonald he being from\nOakland is a section 203 county which means they have multiple languages that they present\ntheir ballots in and so my question really is given that Denver is also a section 203\ncounty we put all of our ballot materials and instructions out in Spanish I wonder if you\ncould share some information maybe about your experience with multiple languages for\nvoters in Oakland thanks yeah it's a real challenge when I was a registrar we had three\nlanguages English, Spanish, and Chinese and anything you do in English you have to do in\nthose other two languages so if you have an English poll worker you have to have a\nSpanish-speaking poll worker and they have to be bilingual which is interesting I got in\ntrouble with the OJ because we had a really hard time finding enough bilingual Chinese\npoll workers I could find poll workers who spoke only Chinese but limited English even\nthough we had other English-speaking poll workers there that was not good enough for DOJ\nand so they dinged us pretty hard on even though we had the poll worker there was not\nbilingual so it is a challenge finding staff as well that speak those languages and I\nthink now I think LA is up to nine languages Los Angeles is up to nine different languages\nso when you look at your ballot it gets even more complicated because you can have all the\nlanguages on one ballot or you can have separate ballots for each language which means in\nCalifornia our ballots are huge it's not unusual for us to have five ballot cards so\nimagine all the boxes you have English boxes, Spanish boxes, Chinese, and so on whatever\nthe other languages are and so it is it is it's tough to do it is real hard so my hat's\noff to anybody that does multiple languages three is is two isn't too bad it's English and\nSpanish because we you can have a bilingual ballot with both languages on a single piece\nof paper but get passed to it it's even more complicated so I don't know if that answers\nthe question one thing I'll add just about about these Bay Area elections in particular\nbut also just about sort of this general question of racial and ethnic minorities and a\nranked-risk ballot in the Bay Area as Dave is saying there's big ballots because they're\nvoting on a lot of things I think San Francisco in 2016 had more than 30 city ballot\nmeasures if I'm remembering right and more than 10 state ballot measures and voting for\npresident and many other offices and then down to the Board of Supervisors using ranked-\nrisk voting so when you're sort of seeing ranked-risk voting results it's in a climate\nwhere people are voting on a lot of things you know a whole lot of people voting by mail a\nwhole lot of people voting in person a whole lot of people you know you know most\ntherefore voting for president or something and you are seeing you know really pretty\neffective use of the ranked-risk ballot across demographics now you'll you'll still see\nkind of a mirror of the the differences of how lower income voters sort of handle ballots\nthan higher income voters but one thing we've looked at very closely is when you're\nparticularly when you're placing two rounds of election almost always one of them has\nlower turnout than the other and when it has lower turnout it's sort of disproportionately\nlower among those communities so any differences that you see and how people of color may\nbe handling say a ranked-risk ballot is much bigger or magnified when it's actually the\ndifferences of a turnout that you see the last thing I'll mention on that is New York City\nused to have 32 local school board elections using ranked-risk voting did it from like the\nby 1970 to the to to about 2000 and there were nine of them and or no 32 of them with nine\nseats on each one so a lot of offices but they were voting by counting by hand and people\nare like oh that's kind of a pain why don't we move them to voting on equipment and and\nnot use the ranked-choice system and the Department of Justice at that point had to pre-\nclear changes to the New York City ballots under under section five of the Voting Rights\nAct and that was actually the last time the DOJ denied pre-clearance to a change because\nthey thought it would be an adverse impact on racial minorities to take away the ranked-\nchoice ballot because of the effective use that they were making of the ranked-choice\nballot so I think we're just going to people should line up because I because I think we\nwant to have questions from the microphone so why don't why don't we do that hello hi\nthanks first of all I want to say thank you it was an awesome presentation but this is a\npolicy question for those that really implemented it in terms of how did you decide on how\nmany choices you were going to give the electorate for each candidate or each race so I'll\njust Minneapolis ours was actually dictated by what our elections equipment could handle\nso that's why we had only three choices our sister city of St. Paul has up to six choices\nbecause they handled it in a different way and so they had different policy choices and\nthe same thing in Alameda County we had three choices really just because our voting\nsystem could only handle three and what we're seeing in the new generous equipment\nincluding I think the Dominion system that people just were trying out that that I believe\ncan do up to 10 rankings so we're going to generally see I think in with with that kind of\nballot design an increased number of rankings I think it's certainly sensible to you know\nwhen it's five or six seven candidates to kind of allow people to rank that many just as\none thing and just about what voters want to do is that in the New York of rather sorry in\nthe in the 2016 presidential cycle we did a poll with College of a William and Mary when\nthe time of Iowa caucuses and Republican contests or 11 candidates and we invited people\nto rank the candidates we didn't say please rank them all we said we invited them to rank\nKansas these were a thousand likely Republican voters from around the country and more\nthan nine out of ten chose to rank everybody and you really saw a lot of coherence and and\nmeaning in their rankings including Donald Trump was the plurality first choice leader and\nthe plurality last choice candidate it's kind of an interesting example of how voters were\nreacting to his candidacy yeah I was just going to say San Francisco I think the\ninitiative was a full ranking but there within the initiative it was written to have the\noption for through only three if that's what the voting equipment would only allow so San\nFrancisco has this elastic thing built into the initiative that they can go to full\nranking hi my name is Raffi my question is more so directed today but please if anyone has\nincites China you had mentioned voter education being a priority when alameda adopted rank\nchoice what was your process in actually gathering your advisors from the community who\ndid you decide to select who did you include in the process yeah it was pretty pretty open\nthe legal women voters was a very active participant and so they had several\nrepresentatives and also in each of the cities there's a you know alameda county is a\npretty liberal area we have a lot of activists you know we're home to Berkeley anybody\nheard of Berkeley here so a pretty liberal city and so there was a very large community of\nactivists and so I invited some of them to be on the committee and it was pretty open I\nmean kind of whoever wanted to be on it with as long as they weren't too disruptive I only\nhad to call a sheriff a couple of times but you know so we had a lot of people on the\nadvisory committee because I figured the more input the better and I and you know what\nhappens when you have a committee like that people are all excited at first and then kind\nof the friends drop out and the ones who are really interested hang in there through the\nwhole time yeah you know um I feel like our voter education work has changed each each\nelection and it's not just about rank choice voting we also had some other reforms from\nthe state of minnesota that I would say sort of layer on to what's happening with rank\nchoice voting including we adopted early voting for the state and that is again then just\na different layer of of kind of how the engagement works in the I think in the original\nyear when the when the materials were developed we had a similar process to what you did\nwhere there was sort of an open invite to engaged constituencies organizations that worked\nin the community trying to get really community-based feedback and we use that to develop\nsome of the materials but not just the materials it was more about then what do we do to\nresource kind of getting out into the community and I would say that's sort of like the\nbiggest thing that has continued every election is I swear there's elections workers but\nalso other kind of nonpartisan groups that just cover the city it feels like for pretty\nlong time during the elections season so there is just a lot of voter engagement happening\na lot of again a lot of nonpartisan voter participation kind of work happening around rank\nchoice voting now it's that one thing and maybe jarard you can amplify on this but my\nrecollection about san francisco is that you know it did a lot of the upfront work which\nis you often see like in the first election and then they do less going forward but they\ndid use some of the cost savings that they were getting from going to rank choice voting\nto ultimately have more lasting staffers involved in voter education for everything if if\nI'm correct me if I'm wrong but they but but then that's there was sort of a new you know\nso the city's saving money but it's it's using a little bit of that to now have staffers\nwho do voter education throughout the time is that well currently it's currently it's the\nstaffers who do the outreach and community but when the ranked choice voting was\nimplemented a lot of the outreach was contracted out we had groups like the gray panther\nsenior citizen group they were funded by department elections to have people from their\norganization go out and make presentations so we actually had some community funding I\nthink the first first two cycles just to do a very blanket outreach hi my name is Celeste\nlandry and I was happy today to see that there was a two-winner race on today's election\nbecause there is a council member race like that in the denver ballot and I want to let\npeople know that I have copies of the Cambridge ballots for this year where they have 26\nrankings for city council and 12 for the school committee and this afternoon Robert she\nand I are going to be giving a talk on multi-winner ranked elections at 130 at the Denver\nPress Club if anybody wants to attend that and I wanted to ask Elizabeth because\nMinneapolis also has a multi-winner race so could you talk a little bit about how that\nworks some people won't be able to make it this afternoon so you'll be all they probably\nhere thanks sure it um this is sort of one of these things honestly like the explaining\nfeels a little more complicated than what it is but we have a park board at large\npositions three and they are elected differently so on your ballot as you fill out the\nballot you select three and then that will ultimately be selected as your three park board\ncandidate so it's different than for each park board candidate that you would have three\nchoices who's going to fill spot one versus spot two versus spot three so it's just a a\ndifferent way a different mechanism and this was again because of how those seats were set\nup in our city charter originally kind of dictated how that how that happened it's sort of\none of these races honestly where I feel like you can get into the weeds with how the\ncounting works in the end how you fill out the ballot and which is I mean in the end the\ncritical piece are people understanding the system are they feeling their ballot out\ncorrectly to me that as a someone who's been a candidate I've and kind of seen how those\nelections work I feel like that's a critical piece there is some ballot design issue to\nthis as well sometimes there's some challenges presented by your elections vendor or your\nso so that's another issue you know and I'll just add that for a multi-winner election\nsystem sort of different algorithms or choices one can make there's sort of ways you can\ndo it where it preserves a majority principle so you know you're interested in design when\nyou're electing one person to uphold the principal and majority rule and you can do that\nso each person has to has to do that when when a multi-winner more common is what they\nwhat they do for the park board elections where they do in Cambridge which is a which is\nto try to have as many people as possible help elect someone and so when you have more\nseats you can actually expand the numbers that are likely do that so in Cambridge you\ngenerally have at least 90 percent of people voting for a winner but they do that by\nhaving each winner not needing 90 percent to win or 50 percent to win but actually needing\nabout a ninth of the vote to win and and and that's how that works but that's that's uh\nthat's uh that's sort of a policy choice for for multi-winner races I thank you for doing\nthis Councilman Paul Lopez represent the west side here in Denver two questions so and and\nthey kind of have to do with each other and I think I alluded to them earlier in our\nprivate conversation but one I'm curious about the interface between this kind of ballot\nand an all-male ballot election and the the the conflict I would see that would present\nitself and wondering how you would reckon reconcile that or if there's a protocol to do so\nif somebody accidentally filled um first choice and fifth choice or for the same person by\nerror in person you'd be able to come up and say hey I messed up kind of get another\nballot printed how do you reconcile that that issue when it comes to an all-male ballot\nand just those dynamics and just want to know what your thoughts are with that dynamic\nwell I can address that in Alameda County over half of our voters vote by mail and half go\nto the polling place so we kind of have that now so if you're at a polling place and you\nmake a mistake on your ballot you know you vote for the same candidate twice and you feed\nit into the machine it'll kick it out right then and the poll worker will give you a fresh\nballot and you can correct your mistake if you want to now if you're voting by mail you\ndon't have that opportunity to correct the mistake so what we do is we scan all those vote\nby mail ballots through a high-speed scanner any ballots that are marked incorrectly will\nget kicked out and then we'll have staff go through and look at those and see if we can\ndetermine why so for instance sometimes what'll happen I'll vote for Rob as my choice and\nthen I'll think about it and I'll scratch it out and vote for somebody else well the\nmachine just sees two votes but if you look at it you can tell what the voter intent was\nso if we know what the voter intent is then we'll copy it to a fresh ballot does that I\nhope that answers the question so we we do our best shot but we can't catch them all yeah\nso I mean knowing what Denver elections does I mean it's the same kind of thought process\nbut I'm just I'm just wondering if there's any policy and protocol on that so I'll just\ntake this short conversation before I'll say what happened in Minneapolis and maybe this\nis kind of how you've ultimately dealt with it is we adapted an ordinance to ensure that\nkind of those policy protocols which are very kind of elections administrator kind of\ndriven on what are those protocols and we're clear transparent and people understood how\nthe ballot would be interpreted again with the intention you're going to give the most\nbenefit of the doubt to the voter so that their votes count what was the name of that\nordinance just we can find it and we can put it up on the I don't know where you're\nposting information but this because this is already addressed actually in most of our\nlaws in Colorado but but we do with our dominion system which is different than what I\nthink any of the systems that are up here we have what we call adjudication and so even\nnow with our mail ballot process if a voter makes a mistake it goes on screen and then we\nhave a whole review process a bipartisan review process where they resolve these\ndiscrepancies and so in a rank choice model we have a voter intent guide it's called and\nso you would still be able to resolve those discrepancies and and resolve them so that the\nballot was counted appropriately we also instruct the good thing about mail ballots and\nthis is kind of one of the things that I know there was a reference to how great that kind\nof model is but with ballot delivery it gives us an ability to to send instructions so\nevery voter in the city gets the exact same instruction and we're no longer relying on\ninstructions happening verbally at polling places or things like that so we've really\nincreased the consistency for how we deliver instructions for voting and we have an\nability to design those instructions as we need to within the packet that every voter gets\nand so one of the things that's kind of happening in addition to this event is next week\nthe Center for Civic Design is going to test out three different basically ways of\ndesigning ballots and three different types of instructions and ask voters for their\nfeedback and then they'll be able to share all that data with us which I think is really\nimportant because the Center for Civic Design not only in ranked choice voting but they've\nbeen doing this work kind of with other types of voting and their research is really\nguiding the way that we now are designing instructions and certainly the way we've done it\nin Denver and Stu Club who's our our staff for that does a lot of this he's really tried\nto adopt the principles of best design so that so that people are getting more visual\nmaterials and better instructions and and you can even see that on some of the ballots\nthat we did I think Jimmy used the Center for Civic Design principles which is really\nhelpful for voters so there's a lot of things in there and and certainly with our voter\nintent structure and Colorado's law for elections we have those things where we always\nwant to make sure that the voters intent is captured regardless and I'm keenly aware that\nI think Alton did a good job in one of our tours last time of kind of showing that behind\nthe scenes process I'm just wondering if that prevalence of those errors increased\ncompared to your typical ballot before or if they kind of stayed the same and I think you\ntalked a little bit about it and just kind of our effect how that would work in our system\nso I appreciate that Amber.",

            "text": "Well I'll start and then others can comment too so so in ranked-choice voting if you like\nin Australia people may know that Australia mandates voting and so it's not everyone votes\nbut they can be fine for not voting they also in that spirit they mandate ranking right so\nthey're really like trying to make a make a choice right and that's not something that's\npart of any ranked-choice voting election use in the United States or anywhere else that I\nknow of and so if you don't mandate ranking then it's possible that you know that your top\nchoices that you've ranked get eliminated and then your ballot's not going to count for\nsomeone right so that if you compare the first round totals with the last round totals\nthere's a certain number of drop-off like people that have chosen not to rank in the\nplaces where they restrict rankings to three that can there be some people who rank three\npeople who just don't get to the final two if it's where they don't have restriction on\nrankings it's sort of a voluntary abstention it's a choice to say you know what I don't\ncare about and these other people you know I'm indifferent to them and I guess my belief\nhas always been well if I'm indifferent to the other people it's sort of like not voting\nin the first but you know it's an abstention so that kind of drop-off which tends by the\nway to be a lot less than in regular runoff elections like the drop-off in regular runoff\nelections as I showed in that slide on average is almost 40% right in the congressional\nrunoff primaries which I know that Utah say is debating and they might end up having you\nknow congressional primary runoffs with probably drop-off to 30, 40 percent what you see\nkind of the drop-off you might see in a righteous voting election is more in the order of\nfive to ten percent you know so it's people that drop-off in a really fractured race like\nthis one in San Francisco you might be referring to no candidate got more than 11 percent\nof first-traces super you know it would have been a fractured race under any circumstance\nand and so a limit of three rankings there were a lot of ballots that didn't didn't end up\ncounting when it got down to two but that's a real outlier the the rest are usually in the\nsort of five to ten percent drop-off um so it's not necessarily a majority of the first\nround but it is a majority of the willing in a sense particularly if there's not a limit\non rankings of people that made a choice they're having a chance to express it and and and\nso it's a majority of the final round might not always be a majority of the first round\nand if anyone else wants to add on to that I think that's a that's a good explanation I\nwill say too where I and maybe Rob you can speak to this the majority vast majority of\nraces seem to have something that is 50 plus one there are some including Minneapolis\nwhere we've had something again because of the drop-off where it is less than 50 percent\nbut still the races I have seen have been in the high 40s so maybe you can speak a little\nbit to when we talk about plurality winner you know what what does that look like in\nranked choice voting yeah and it's obviously there's a different different measure also of\nsort of what voters might be meaning like in the current Minneapolis mayor the race that\njust happened the winner was ranked in the top three out of it was 10 candidates for mayor\n11 more something like that something a bunch of candidates and this person I think maybe\neven 15 or something right so ranked in the top three by more than half of voters however\nsome of those voters ranked his opponent in the final round as a higher choice so he's\ndeboused in count for him in the final choice because they were counting for someone else\nbut those voters had made a sort of a expression of interest and support for for that\ncandidate and so if you look at that way you almost always get the winners getting\nexpressions of support for more than 50 percent and from in a sense from the voter\nperspective they made a sense feel feel represented by that person to a degree right you\nknow like like they they made an affirmative decision to rank them but anyway that's sort\nof getting in the weeds but it is sort of a way that it's a different it's not just sort\nof a one-on-one thing it's a it's how you attract support from a from a community of\npeople and certainly the candidates see it that way where they need to reach out to as\nmany people as possible so when the the new mayor of Minneapolis you know got an\naffirmative expression of support for more than half the voters and that to me seems\nimportant.",

    "summary": "Okay so this is the next thing that happened in Minneapolis in our 2017 election and I'll\nwe have an example from the mayor's race and then we have an example from a candidate's\nrace that I want to share but we just had tremendous participation in people ranking their\nballots so they didn't just show up and rank their favorite candidate they ranked at least\ntwo and many ranked three candidates and so here if you're able to I think this is kind of\nsmall but I will read out in the mayor's race 87 percent of voters ranked at least two\ncandidates 73 percent of voters ranked at least three candidates and I will say and again\nwhen we look at the mayor's example you'll see this a little bit more we had an\ninteresting field in city elections in Minneapolis in 2017 where we probably had I\nconsider five of those candidates for mayor to have visible and viable campaigns and when\nwe look at this election I'll kind of tell you who raised the most money and who didn't\nand you'll see it's kind of surprising actually when you look at who won. We had just a\ntremendously diverse slate of candidates again I think this goes to this issue of who who\nis who is electing these candidates so now you are as a candidate you have one election\nit's more about turnout it is about reaching as many voters as possible it's about talking\nto everyone that you can even those who have said someone else is my first choice and we\nheard candidates say that they felt more comfortable coming into the race even if they\nweren't sure how viable they were in the beginning so we ended up with again just a very\ndiverse slate of candidates these are people who were elected the first two transgender\ncouncil members were elected in the first Somali American and Latina council members were\nreelected in this election and for Minneapolis this is a big change and again this is not\nfully reflecting the whole slate of candidates who are running all right let's see I'm\ngoing to skip that okay so I wanted to get to this example from the mayor's race so here\nwe have let's see one two three four five so we have essentially what I talked about were\nthese top five my year old candidates and then this was other so again this was kind of an\ninteresting race we have an incumbent who was running for your election and she did not\nwin her race two years four years ago when we had a mayoral election we had what I think\nis had been more traditional than what I had seen which is that you had like a couple of\ncandidates just sort of rise above the pack and kind of hold on to that so it felt even\nthough like there were more candidates it felt like there were two main candidates that\nwas not the feel in Minneapolis this year you saw I'm gonna go through here so here they\nfirst eliminated the other candidates and we knew who won the mayor's race we had an\ninclination of who might win the day of the election and we had final confirmed results\nfor the mayor's race by the early afternoon of the next day so those ballots moved to\nvoter second choices um round two round three Nakema Levy pounds is eliminated she was the\nAfrican-American woman who was featured in the early video she was a candidate I'll just\nsay in the last elections report that I saw she raised only $40,000 so I just want to say\nthis is like an election where someone like that who I will say was someone who had a lot\nof popular following um was able to come out um in the top five candidates in a\ncompetitive uh race all this in she had a baby uh on the campaign trail um yes um Tom Hoke\nis eliminated I'll just want to mention him because he was a candidate who raised the most\nmoney um he spent a lot of his own personal fortune um he raised about $750,000 that he\nspent on the race um so he was gone next I'll just flip through this because I will say on\nour elections website which you can see at vote.miniapolismn.gov they have a very\ninteresting graphic that shows how people's votes uh went once they were eliminated and so\nyou might just want to take a look at that Betsy Hodges is eliminated she was the\nincumbent mayor her um and then we had whoops then we had a winner with 57% of uh of\ncounted ballots or continuing ballots all right this is one other race just to kind of\ntake a look at because there's this kind of shorter story to tell here um this was a race\nbetween um a 20-year incumbent and uh she had two challengers um this was a race we we do\ndo endorsing of candidates in Minneapolis nobody was endorsed in this race by the party um\nalthough the challenger Philippe Cunningham was the closest um and um what ended up\nhappening here was uh so there's round one um there were two challengers Stephanie Gasca\nand Philippe Cunningham and in round two Gasca and then another candidate Hanson were\neliminated um um there um Gasca and Cunningham clearly were aligned candidates um they uh\nand they ended up promoting a message towards the end of the campaign where they\nencouraged uh the other person's supporters to please rank them as their second choice so\nthere was an alignment that that happened there and in the end even though Barb Johnson\nwas first in the early round um Philippe Cunningham received the lion share of these other\nvotes this was a big story he was um uh he was a surprise candidate to win that race and\nthis is just another graphic of that but she she was not successful the incumbent in\nattracting enough second choice votes to put her over the edge and this is uh the winner\num Philippe Cunningham um I think I've taken up quite a bit of time here but I will just\nsay um that I feel sad that we weren't able to have our elections uh our city clerk here\nCasey Carl um he had to deal with a recount in one of our races and he's preparing for you\nknow a new mayor and a bunch of new council members um but uh people should feel free to\nreach out um to Casey Carl and the city of Minneapolis he has been a great advocate of how\nto institute this elections method uh well with integrity our elections team has won some\nnational awards and also just to this point of engagement with voters um I feel like our\nwhole elections team has continued just to be creative and how to engage with voters it's\nlike the workaround ranked choice voting has ushered in a whole new um kind of way to do\nthe work of the elections department where they now perceive that part of their work is\nabout continuously educating and engaging with voters making sure they have good\ninformation about how to fill out their ballots and all this kind of thing so um it has\nushered in um also a lot of policy changes at the city of Minneapolis on how to make\nthings work the best way that they can for voters so thanks for letting me share our story\nthank you Elizabeth one more speaker um and thanks thanks for uh sticking with us and um\nterrific set of information being presented I hope I'll um say the one part of the\nMinneapolis story that sort of jumps out to me from like looking at that mayoral result is\nthat if it had been the old system in Minneapolis and those first choices had translated\ninto votes which you don't know for sure would have happened but it would have been the\ntwo biggest spenders to white men would have advanced and been the only general election\ncandidate when turnout was much higher but they had this sort of richer debate with with\nwith more people which is analogous to what Denver where you don't have this sort of win-\na-win election you have everyone run in the first round um and someone can win in the\nfirst round but some of the systems out there wouldn't allow that um and uh say Paul also\nused ranked risk voting and they sort of interesting example of it was a big open seat\nrace for mayor people thought it would have multiple rounds um 10 candidates running and a\ncandidate ultimately won 51 percent of first choices so sort of uh sort of pushed forward\nand uh people will be the first African American mayor of St. Paul but part of the\ncoverage of it that I've really appreciated just following was that people you know felt\nthat all these candidates contributed to the dialogue about the city so even if it sort of\nlooked like a first round result where just it was normal you had sort of people be be be\nbe part of the part of the dialogue and and and part of what he as a successful candidate\nhad to learn how to be people's second choices uh so our last speaker is going to be\nConnie Schmidt and um one of the the the great uh advances for us at Fair Vote is the the\nrise of the ranked risk voting resource center which is uh run by uh former election\nofficials all with some direct experience with ranked risk voting but who can really get\ninto how to make this work and how it's working and be a resource to communities and\nstates as as they look at ranked risk voting and Connie is is an example of what a great\nasset they have she was election commissioner for Johnson County Kansas for nine years uh\nCity Clerk for Merriam Kansas for 20 years has been doing a lot of consulting uh was done\nfrom work with the uh election assistance commission and uh direct uh consulting to Casey\nCarl and some work in uh Minneapolis so Connie Thank you Rob and thank you Amber and your\ngroup for hosting this event it's a very nice turnout we're very happy to be here um as\nRob said my background is totally in um local government and service to the public and um\nthe last nine years were spent um but the best job on earth which was managing elections\nin the large county and Kansas in the Kansas City metro area since then it's been a lot of\nmy privilege to work around the country um with a lot of um initiatives in various states\nand jurisdictions um in 2011 2013 2017 in Minneapolis where I learned for the first time\nabout ranked choice voting the last couple of years it's been another privilege for me to\nbe associated with a team of people that developed the ranked choice voting resource\ncenter and I'm really excited about it because it is basically um a place where any\nelection administrator voter public official anyone candidate if you have any questions\nabout ranked choice voting you can go to this website rankedchoicevoting.org and you will\nfind all of the information that we have been able to find anywhere across the country and\nso the group that I'm working with as Rob said are retired uh and former election\nadministrators um we're very big believers in elections and sharing best practices so that\nno one has to reinvent the wheel and so um we're very proud of everything that we have\nthere it's from all the jurisdictions across the country who have um implemented ranked\nchoice voting from legislation um to any other kind of ideas that are there um part of the\nthings that it includes is a compilation of really what is ranked choice voting and so you\ncan click on various tabs on the website if you're a voter or you're a candidate or you're\nan election administrator and go to various places of information that would help you\nunderstand what it is um for example there's information on how to mark your ballot and so\nyou if you were a voter or if you were running for office there's information there um\nfrom other places across the country including samples um we have information on single-\nwinner ranked choice voter and multi-winner ranked choice voting races um the election\ntoolkit is probably one of my favorite places um we have started this year um a webinar\nseries that we've been doing online and i'll talk a little about that in a moment um we\nhave a lot of reports and presentations that we have done across the country and various\nreports that i'll um talk about we've been working with the center-fecivic design on\nusability toolkits and education toolkits um so the first thing um the webinar series and\nthose webinars are posted on that website so if you're interested in you want of them or\nall of them you can go on your own and view those um the first one we did was to introduce\neverybody to really what the ranked choice voting resource center is and how we can help\nyou and i need to add that our services are provided free of charge to any jurisdiction\nincluding travel so we are here um as a resource and to help in any way we can one webinar\nwas basically the ABCs of ranked choice voting and that was kind of a um a introduction to\nwhat is ranked choice voting and what does it mean where is it being used and then we've\ndone one on the history going back to the beginning of when ranked choice voting was first\nstarted in the united states and then the usability studies on how to design a ballot\nvoting systems capabilities including statewide how do you do this for a whole state and\ndesigning the most important which is voter education and how to present election results\nto the voters we're going to be doing more webinars um in 2018 and again those are all\ngoing to be posted on our website as we go along um the toolkit um has a variety of\nreports and presentations that our team has put together um the first one we did we called\nit the ranked choice voting compilation and you can print it out there it has active\nhyperlinks throughout the document that will take you to other best practices across the\ncountry but it's basically just that it's where has this been done before how can I see\nwhat was done before how can I get an example of how someone else that managed elections\ndid this and so that's where we'll find that the other report that I think is really good\nis implementation um of ranked choice voting with multiple voting systems you're fortunate\nin Colorado you have all one voting system statewide not every state has that convenience\nthere are many states that have um various voting vendors throughout the jurisdictions and\nthe model RCB implementation plan is one that we've just finished in September and it\nbasically takes it's a road map that we put together for any jurisdiction that was\nthinking about going to ranked choice voting as a model for managing elections from how do\nyou pass legislation what are some examples of model legislation that you can take a look\nat and print off um to how do you do voter education all the way through how do you build\nthe ballot and how do you actually provide election results on election night so there's a\nlot of really good information in um these reports and presentations um the one thing I\nwanted to um talk about very briefly is the center for civic design um we have several\nreports on the website that they have done they've been a wonderful partner to fair vote\nand the ranked choice voting resource center I think you have some handouts on your table\non the website we have the principles and guidelines report that was done by their team\nthe ballot design testing documents and I understand they're going to be here in Denver um\nlater this month to do some more for you all voter education testing documents and they\ndid go to Minneapolis and they have tested a lot of this information there and how do you\npresent election results on election night um to your voters and to the candidates so some\nof the highlights um for their design report and I have to say many of these when I was\nreading through these preparing this PowerPoint pertain to elections in general and I\nthink one of my colleagues earlier said the same thing it's really not any different than\njust managing the normal election so many of the guidelines you're going to see for the\ncenter for civic design pertain to any election that you're doing give voters the\ninformation they need to prepare to vote the only thing is when you're going to rank\nchoice voting from a normal regular election where they just vote for one person you have\nto explain the benefits and the basics of what is ranked choice voting be prepared to\nanswer their questions and be able to show voters how their ballot is actually going to be\nused in counting and tallying election results um and so one way to do that is this is a\nsample they may be on your tables I think I might have seen this one um that the center\nfor civic design put together so basically in very simple language what is ranked choice\nvoting why are we using it with as few awards as possible and you notice their icons and\ntheir words at the bottom for why it's being used save money stronger voices broader\nparticipation and so those simple words can can help a voter and the general public\nunderstand more about how to use it so that's an example that they put together another\nguideline that they presented was all of the information should be in clear and simple\nlanguage any of us that have been in elections for any period of time have this kind of\npounded into us clear and simple language is very important keep the information short and\nto the point and use everyday words so that anyone will be able to understand it in\nelections we kind of call it kindergarten words you know make it simple for everyone use\nillustrations anytime you can and use icons very sparingly to draw attention to different\ntypes of information and I have added the Minneapolis voter guide from 2017 and they're\nreally proud of it they've done a great job in Minneapolis through the years improving\neach year on the process their mission um that we kind of started in 2013 was to be the\ngold standard for ranked choice voting and I'm so proud to say that they really are um so\nthis voter guide that they did in 2017 utilize the information from the Center for Civic\ndesign on how to do this best some other information that was presented um is the how to\ndo election results on election nine and as Councilwoman Glidden pointed out the\nMinneapolis folks really set a high standard in the 2017 election if you can go to their\nwebsite and click on the mayor's race you can see this really marvelous visual of how each\nground of tabulation moved various results from one candidate to the other candidates so\nthey did a very very good job on that but use a combination of text and graphics to tell\nyour story use color and shading icons to draw attention to the various pieces it's\nimportant to include the details of where their voters expect them and use labels to\nremind the voters of the most important information and probably the most important thing\nis to use plain language if you're explaining local or state laws and terms and just very\nfew words to help people understand an example is this visual I think it's on your table\nthat the center for civic design created for us in partnership and it does show how each\nperson's unique ballot and vote for each round is being tabulated and so anytime you can\ndo any kind of a visual something like this it really helps the voters and the general\npublic and I have to say the media too because we have to educate the media on what is\nranked choice voting and how it is secure and how we are going to tabulate the results and\nso I wanted to show you a couple more examples of a way you can present this information\nso that the public can understand how the votes are being reallocated to other candidates\nas the tabulation occurs on election night everybody is used to having election results\nbefore the 10 o'clock news right well and sometimes in ranked choice voting we it takes a\nlittle bit longer as the gentleman from Alameda indicated that they still are counting\nmail ballots after the election night so the same thing is going to happen with ranked\nchoice voting it will take some time to pull all the election results together some of the\ncandidates will automatically win on election night if they receive over 51 percent of the\nvote those that don't will have to go into the rounds of tabulation this is an example of\na grid style ballot is there on your left if you're looking at it on your right is the\ncolumns and there are various ways you can design the ballot Minneapolis allows ranking of\nup to three voters three candidates I'm sorry other jurisdictions rank up to six and maybe\nup to 10 candidates that's a decision that you'll have to make but you'll notice the voter\ninstructions at the top it's really important to show a little visual for what they how to\nactually mark the ballot and it's that that's a really important piece of all of it I\nwanted to talk a little bit about educating the public again and partial to Minneapolis\nbecause that's where I've worked in ranked choice voting but they've done a really good\njob on their website and I have the address their vote manyapolismn.gov and you can go\nthere and just get all kinds of background information for how they implemented it\nstarting in 2009 they use social media I know y'all do here in Denver too Twitter Facebook\nto keep the public and the voters and the candidates informed and engaged in the entire\nprocess including on election night when we were doing tabulation the use of Twitter and\nFacebook was a really good way to keep everybody engaged they have a video I'm going to\nshow at the end on how tabulation occurs that's on their website also they do voter\noutreach handouts in various languages the one that really helped them the most I think is\nthe voter information guide mailing they mail this to every household in the city of\nMinneapolis and in ranked choice voting elections which is once every four years they\ninclude more information about what ranked choice voting is and how it works and they do a\npost-election survey they have in 2013 I believe they did it again this year surveying\nelection workers and voters and various people and the voter guide was identified as the\nmost effective tool for learning about ranked choice voting but I have to stop here and\nagain always say that our most important informant of to the voters is our poll workers in\nthe polling places on election day my colleagues in North Carolina who did a ranked choice\nvoting statewide election in a very short period of time the poll workers in the polling\nplaces are the ones that really really helped inform the voters and be sure they had the\nright information how it works educating the voters I have this handout available over\nhere if some of you would like to take that this is what Minneapolis uses it tells people\nhow not to do what not to do with the big red circle and the line drawn through it it also\nprovides information at the bottom about how to count your vote and it also says that if\nyou've made a mistake on your ballot you can please ask for another ballot and you can\nstart over so that is like a poster that's in every voting location which is also really\nreally good I wanted to give you just a couple of statistical things because I love\nstatistics and looking back on Minneapolis this is from November of 2013 I don't know they\nhave all of these numbers put together from this past November's election but I think it's\nimportant to note that the over votes in are very very less than less than 0.5% which is\nprobably comparable to any normal election that you have skipped rankings there was again\nless than 0.5% they repeated the candidates in a few and so that was an area they\nidentified by looking at these statistics that they had to do a little better job on voter\neducation and so that's the benefit of doing some of these post-election statistics and\nanalysis of how the ballots were actually voted you can see where do you need to continue\nto engage with the voters to be sure that they understand the next one relates to how many\npeople voted how many choices how many people were ranked in the mayor's race in 2013\nwhile over 75% of the voters did three choices they ranked all three choices again there\nwere a lot of candidates for mayor you'll notice if you can see this I'm not sure if\neveryone can the city council race that only had one candidate well of course only 96% of\nthe people ranked more than only but only ranked one candidate because it was only one but\nif you look down any race that had more than three or four candidates they chose at least\nthree choices when they were ranking their ballot and so these are really good statistics\nto go back and look at post-election when you can review everything after you've got the\nelection certified the last thing I want to show is the video and let me see if I can do\nthis this is on the city of Minneapolis website and it's a really nice little simple easy\nto understand visual about how we're going to count the votes on election night so I'm\ngoing to see if this were oops it didn't work so I'm going to rely on the gentleman to\nmake it go in most elections you only vote for one candidate for each office but in some\nelections voters can rank three or more candidates for each office it's called ranked\nchoice voting here's an example of how it works all of the candidates will be listed on\nthe ballot in three columns make your first choice vote in column one by filling in the\noval of the candidate you'd most like to win vote for your second choice in column two and\nmake your third choice in column three that's all there is to it now let's see how the\nvotes are counted let's say there are four candidates running for mayor Asha, Zach, Omar\nand Lucy once the polls close we count all the first choice votes first to be elected\nmayor a candidate needs more than half the votes in this example Asha has more than half\nof the votes so she's declared the winner however if no candidate gets more than half the\nvotes we start eliminating candidates and counting the next choices of those who voted in\nthis example Zach is the candidate with the smallest number of first choice votes so he is\ncut we use the second choice votes on Zach's ballots and count those voters second choices\ninstead if one of the remaining candidates now has more than half of the total votes that\ncandidate is declared the winner if not the next lowest candidate Lucy is eliminated her\nvotes are now counted for the next choice on the ballot some of Lucy's votes went to Zach\nwho was already eliminated so those new votes for Zach instead count for those voters\nthird choice candidate we are now down to two candidates and Omar clearly has more than\nhalf of the votes that makes him the winner that's how ranked choice voting works for more\ninformation on ranked choice voting visit our website okay thank you all right thank you\nConnie so I think we're actually going to try to get a hands-on experience next so maybe\nAmber will introduce us to that opportunity okay so we've got a couple of ways that we can\ntest this out first you have some paper ballots that should be on your table we also have\nthe tablets that are in the back of the room against the far wall once we collect\neverything we will count in the in the tabulation room and bring the results out and show\nwhat those look like on the screen I think what I'll do is I'm going to kick off with one\nquestion that I have just given Denver and the jurisdiction that we have here in the city\nand county of Denver and the question I have is actually for Dave McDonald he being from\nOakland is a section 203 county which means they have multiple languages that they present\ntheir ballots in and so my question really is given that Denver is also a section 203\ncounty we put all of our ballot materials and instructions out in Spanish I wonder if you\ncould share some information maybe about your experience with multiple languages for\nvoters in Oakland thanks yeah it's a real challenge when I was a registrar we had three\nlanguages English, Spanish, and Chinese and anything you do in English you have to do in\nthose other two languages so if you have an English poll worker you have to have a\nSpanish-speaking poll worker and they have to be bilingual which is interesting I got in\ntrouble with the OJ because we had a really hard time finding enough bilingual Chinese\npoll workers I could find poll workers who spoke only Chinese but limited English even\nthough we had other English-speaking poll workers there that was not good enough for DOJ\nand so they dinged us pretty hard on even though we had the poll worker there was not\nbilingual so it is a challenge finding staff as well that speak those languages and I\nthink now I think LA is up to nine languages Los Angeles is up to nine different languages\nso when you look at your ballot it gets even more complicated because you can have all the\nlanguages on one ballot or you can have separate ballots for each language which means in\nCalifornia our ballots are huge it's not unusual for us to have five ballot cards so\nimagine all the boxes you have English boxes, Spanish boxes, Chinese, and so on whatever\nthe other languages are and so it is it is it's tough to do it is real hard so my hat's\noff to anybody that does multiple languages three is is two isn't too bad it's English and\nSpanish because we you can have a bilingual ballot with both languages on a single piece\nof paper but get passed to it it's even more complicated so I don't know if that answers\nthe question one thing I'll add just about about these Bay Area elections in particular\nbut also just about sort of this general question of racial and ethnic minorities and a\nranked-risk ballot in the Bay Area as Dave is saying there's big ballots because they're\nvoting on a lot of things I think San Francisco in 2016 had more than 30 city ballot\nmeasures if I'm remembering right and more than 10 state ballot measures and voting for\npresident and many other offices and then down to the Board of Supervisors using ranked-\nrisk voting so when you're sort of seeing ranked-risk voting results it's in a climate\nwhere people are voting on a lot of things you know a whole lot of people voting by mail a\nwhole lot of people voting in person a whole lot of people you know you know most\ntherefore voting for president or something and you are seeing you know really pretty\neffective use of the ranked-risk ballot across demographics now you'll you'll still see\nkind of a mirror of the the differences of how lower income voters sort of handle ballots\nthan higher income voters but one thing we've looked at very closely is when you're\nparticularly when you're placing two rounds of election almost always one of them has\nlower turnout than the other and when it has lower turnout it's sort of disproportionately\nlower among those communities so any differences that you see and how people of color may\nbe handling say a ranked-risk ballot is much bigger or magnified when it's actually the\ndifferences of a turnout that you see the last thing I'll mention on that is New York City\nused to have 32 local school board elections using ranked-risk voting did it from like the\nby 1970 to the to to about 2000 and there were nine of them and or no 32 of them with nine\nseats on each one so a lot of offices but they were voting by counting by hand and people\nare like oh that's kind of a pain why don't we move them to voting on equipment and and\nnot use the ranked-choice system and the Department of Justice at that point had to pre-\nclear changes to the New York City ballots under under section five of the Voting Rights\nAct and that was actually the last time the DOJ denied pre-clearance to a change because\nthey thought it would be an adverse impact on racial minorities to take away the ranked-\nchoice ballot because of the effective use that they were making of the ranked-choice\nballot so I think we're just going to people should line up because I because I think we\nwant to have questions from the microphone so why don't why don't we do that hello hi\nthanks first of all I want to say thank you it was an awesome presentation but this is a\npolicy question for those that really implemented it in terms of how did you decide on how\nmany choices you were going to give the electorate for each candidate or each race so I'll\njust Minneapolis ours was actually dictated by what our elections equipment could handle\nso that's why we had only three choices our sister city of St. Paul has up to six choices\nbecause they handled it in a different way and so they had different policy choices and\nthe same thing in Alameda County we had three choices really just because our voting\nsystem could only handle three and what we're seeing in the new generous equipment\nincluding I think the Dominion system that people just were trying out that that I believe\ncan do up to 10 rankings so we're going to generally see I think in with with that kind of\nballot design an increased number of rankings I think it's certainly sensible to you know\nwhen it's five or six seven candidates to kind of allow people to rank that many just as\none thing and just about what voters want to do is that in the New York of rather sorry in\nthe in the 2016 presidential cycle we did a poll with College of a William and Mary when\nthe time of Iowa caucuses and Republican contests or 11 candidates and we invited people\nto rank the candidates we didn't say please rank them all we said we invited them to rank\nKansas these were a thousand likely Republican voters from around the country and more\nthan nine out of ten chose to rank everybody and you really saw a lot of coherence and and\nmeaning in their rankings including Donald Trump was the plurality first choice leader and\nthe plurality last choice candidate it's kind of an interesting example of how voters were\nreacting to his candidacy yeah I was just going to say San Francisco I think the\ninitiative was a full ranking but there within the initiative it was written to have the\noption for through only three if that's what the voting equipment would only allow so San\nFrancisco has this elastic thing built into the initiative that they can go to full\nranking hi my name is Raffi my question is more so directed today but please if anyone has\nincites China you had mentioned voter education being a priority when alameda adopted rank\nchoice what was your process in actually gathering your advisors from the community who\ndid you decide to select who did you include in the process yeah it was pretty pretty open\nthe legal women voters was a very active participant and so they had several\nrepresentatives and also in each of the cities there's a you know alameda county is a\npretty liberal area we have a lot of activists you know we're home to Berkeley anybody\nheard of Berkeley here so a pretty liberal city and so there was a very large community of\nactivists and so I invited some of them to be on the committee and it was pretty open I\nmean kind of whoever wanted to be on it with as long as they weren't too disruptive I only\nhad to call a sheriff a couple of times but you know so we had a lot of people on the\nadvisory committee because I figured the more input the better and I and you know what\nhappens when you have a committee like that people are all excited at first and then kind\nof the friends drop out and the ones who are really interested hang in there through the\nwhole time yeah you know um I feel like our voter education work has changed each each\nelection and it's not just about rank choice voting we also had some other reforms from\nthe state of minnesota that I would say sort of layer on to what's happening with rank\nchoice voting including we adopted early voting for the state and that is again then just\na different layer of of kind of how the engagement works in the I think in the original\nyear when the when the materials were developed we had a similar process to what you did\nwhere there was sort of an open invite to engaged constituencies organizations that worked\nin the community trying to get really community-based feedback and we use that to develop\nsome of the materials but not just the materials it was more about then what do we do to\nresource kind of getting out into the community and I would say that's sort of like the\nbiggest thing that has continued every election is I swear there's elections workers but\nalso other kind of nonpartisan groups that just cover the city it feels like for pretty\nlong time during the elections season so there is just a lot of voter engagement happening\na lot of again a lot of nonpartisan voter participation kind of work happening around rank\nchoice voting now it's that one thing and maybe jarard you can amplify on this but my\nrecollection about san francisco is that you know it did a lot of the upfront work which\nis you often see like in the first election and then they do less going forward but they\ndid use some of the cost savings that they were getting from going to rank choice voting\nto ultimately have more lasting staffers involved in voter education for everything if if\nI'm correct me if I'm wrong but they but but then that's there was sort of a new you know\nso the city's saving money but it's it's using a little bit of that to now have staffers\nwho do voter education throughout the time is that well currently it's currently it's the\nstaffers who do the outreach and community but when the ranked choice voting was\nimplemented a lot of the outreach was contracted out we had groups like the gray panther\nsenior citizen group they were funded by department elections to have people from their\norganization go out and make presentations so we actually had some community funding I\nthink the first first two cycles just to do a very blanket outreach hi my name is Celeste\nlandry and I was happy today to see that there was a two-winner race on today's election\nbecause there is a council member race like that in the denver ballot and I want to let\npeople know that I have copies of the Cambridge ballots for this year where they have 26\nrankings for city council and 12 for the school committee and this afternoon Robert she\nand I are going to be giving a talk on multi-winner ranked elections at 130 at the Denver\nPress Club if anybody wants to attend that and I wanted to ask Elizabeth because\nMinneapolis also has a multi-winner race so could you talk a little bit about how that\nworks some people won't be able to make it this afternoon so you'll be all they probably\nhere thanks sure it um this is sort of one of these things honestly like the explaining\nfeels a little more complicated than what it is but we have a park board at large\npositions three and they are elected differently so on your ballot as you fill out the\nballot you select three and then that will ultimately be selected as your three park board\ncandidate so it's different than for each park board candidate that you would have three\nchoices who's going to fill spot one versus spot two versus spot three so it's just a a\ndifferent way a different mechanism and this was again because of how those seats were set\nup in our city charter originally kind of dictated how that how that happened it's sort of\none of these races honestly where I feel like you can get into the weeds with how the\ncounting works in the end how you fill out the ballot and which is I mean in the end the\ncritical piece are people understanding the system are they feeling their ballot out\ncorrectly to me that as a someone who's been a candidate I've and kind of seen how those\nelections work I feel like that's a critical piece there is some ballot design issue to\nthis as well sometimes there's some challenges presented by your elections vendor or your\nso so that's another issue you know and I'll just add that for a multi-winner election\nsystem sort of different algorithms or choices one can make there's sort of ways you can\ndo it where it preserves a majority principle so you know you're interested in design when\nyou're electing one person to uphold the principal and majority rule and you can do that\nso each person has to has to do that when when a multi-winner more common is what they\nwhat they do for the park board elections where they do in Cambridge which is a which is\nto try to have as many people as possible help elect someone and so when you have more\nseats you can actually expand the numbers that are likely do that so in Cambridge you\ngenerally have at least 90 percent of people voting for a winner but they do that by\nhaving each winner not needing 90 percent to win or 50 percent to win but actually needing\nabout a ninth of the vote to win and and and that's how that works but that's that's uh\nthat's uh that's sort of a policy choice for for multi-winner races I thank you for doing\nthis Councilman Paul Lopez represent the west side here in Denver two questions so and and\nthey kind of have to do with each other and I think I alluded to them earlier in our\nprivate conversation but one I'm curious about the interface between this kind of ballot\nand an all-male ballot election and the the the conflict I would see that would present\nitself and wondering how you would reckon reconcile that or if there's a protocol to do so\nif somebody accidentally filled um first choice and fifth choice or for the same person by\nerror in person you'd be able to come up and say hey I messed up kind of get another\nballot printed how do you reconcile that that issue when it comes to an all-male ballot\nand just those dynamics and just want to know what your thoughts are with that dynamic\nwell I can address that in Alameda County over half of our voters vote by mail and half go\nto the polling place so we kind of have that now so if you're at a polling place and you\nmake a mistake on your ballot you know you vote for the same candidate twice and you feed\nit into the machine it'll kick it out right then and the poll worker will give you a fresh\nballot and you can correct your mistake if you want to now if you're voting by mail you\ndon't have that opportunity to correct the mistake so what we do is we scan all those vote\nby mail ballots through a high-speed scanner any ballots that are marked incorrectly will\nget kicked out and then we'll have staff go through and look at those and see if we can\ndetermine why so for instance sometimes what'll happen I'll vote for Rob as my choice and\nthen I'll think about it and I'll scratch it out and vote for somebody else well the\nmachine just sees two votes but if you look at it you can tell what the voter intent was\nso if we know what the voter intent is then we'll copy it to a fresh ballot does that I\nhope that answers the question so we we do our best shot but we can't catch them all yeah\nso I mean knowing what Denver elections does I mean it's the same kind of thought process\nbut I'm just I'm just wondering if there's any policy and protocol on that so I'll just\ntake this short conversation before I'll say what happened in Minneapolis and maybe this\nis kind of how you've ultimately dealt with it is we adapted an ordinance to ensure that\nkind of those policy protocols which are very kind of elections administrator kind of\ndriven on what are those protocols and we're clear transparent and people understood how\nthe ballot would be interpreted again with the intention you're going to give the most\nbenefit of the doubt to the voter so that their votes count what was the name of that\nordinance just we can find it and we can put it up on the I don't know where you're\nposting information but this because this is already addressed actually in most of our\nlaws in Colorado but but we do with our dominion system which is different than what I\nthink any of the systems that are up here we have what we call adjudication and so even\nnow with our mail ballot process if a voter makes a mistake it goes on screen and then we\nhave a whole review process a bipartisan review process where they resolve these\ndiscrepancies and so in a rank choice model we have a voter intent guide it's called and\nso you would still be able to resolve those discrepancies and and resolve them so that the\nballot was counted appropriately we also instruct the good thing about mail ballots and\nthis is kind of one of the things that I know there was a reference to how great that kind\nof model is but with ballot delivery it gives us an ability to to send instructions so\nevery voter in the city gets the exact same instruction and we're no longer relying on\ninstructions happening verbally at polling places or things like that so we've really\nincreased the consistency for how we deliver instructions for voting and we have an\nability to design those instructions as we need to within the packet that every voter gets\nand so one of the things that's kind of happening in addition to this event is next week\nthe Center for Civic Design is going to test out three different basically ways of\ndesigning ballots and three different types of instructions and ask voters for their\nfeedback and then they'll be able to share all that data with us which I think is really\nimportant because the Center for Civic Design not only in ranked choice voting but they've\nbeen doing this work kind of with other types of voting and their research is really\nguiding the way that we now are designing instructions and certainly the way we've done it\nin Denver and Stu Club who's our our staff for that does a lot of this he's really tried\nto adopt the principles of best design so that so that people are getting more visual\nmaterials and better instructions and and you can even see that on some of the ballots\nthat we did I think Jimmy used the Center for Civic Design principles which is really\nhelpful for voters so there's a lot of things in there and and certainly with our voter\nintent structure and Colorado's law for elections we have those things where we always\nwant to make sure that the voters intent is captured regardless and I'm keenly aware that\nI think Alton did a good job in one of our tours last time of kind of showing that behind\nthe scenes process I'm just wondering if that prevalence of those errors increased\ncompared to your typical ballot before or if they kind of stayed the same and I think you\ntalked a little bit about it and just kind of our effect how that would work in our system\nso I appreciate that Amber. And I think the the issues are very similar for RCV and non-\nRCV races right you can make a mistake on a non-RCV race and still have to figure out how\nto get your ballot but the one thing that I believe and I'm going to confirm this I don't\nknow if Dave has the numbers but but in I'm pretty sure that the rates of at least\ninvalidated ballots are not anymore with vote by mail than the in person which is quite\ninteresting when you think about it but they also have more time right so there's that's\nand that's again just vote by mail versus in a person voting for everybody but they have a\nlittle more time a little more time to think about the candidates and you know one of the\nthings that's interesting about ranked votes voting is a crazy new incentives to find out\nmore about candidates and candidates to tell you more about themselves and so there's a\nvoters tend to learn a little bit more about their voting whether they're voting in person\nor voting by mail. Well I'll start and then others can comment too so so in ranked-choice\nvoting if you like in Australia people may know that Australia mandates voting and so it's\nnot everyone votes but they can be fine for not voting they also in that spirit they\nmandate ranking right so they're really like trying to make a make a choice right and\nthat's not something that's part of any ranked-choice voting election use in the United\nStates or anywhere else that I know of and so if you don't mandate ranking then it's\npossible that you know that your top choices that you've ranked get eliminated and then\nyour ballot's not going to count for someone right so that if you compare the first round\ntotals with the last round totals there's a certain number of drop-off like people that\nhave chosen not to rank in the places where they restrict rankings to three that can there\nbe some people who rank three people who just don't get to the final two if it's where\nthey don't have restriction on rankings it's sort of a voluntary abstention it's a choice\nto say you know what I don't care about and these other people you know I'm indifferent to\nthem and I guess my belief has always been well if I'm indifferent to the other people\nit's sort of like not voting in the first but you know it's an abstention so that kind of\ndrop-off which tends by the way to be a lot less than in regular runoff elections like the\ndrop-off in regular runoff elections as I showed in that slide on average is almost 40%\nright in the congressional runoff primaries which I know that Utah say is debating and\nthey might end up having you know congressional primary runoffs with probably drop-off to\n30, 40 percent what you see kind of the drop-off you might see in a righteous voting\nelection is more in the order of five to ten percent you know so it's people that drop-off\nin a really fractured race like this one in San Francisco you might be referring to no\ncandidate got more than 11 percent of first-traces super you know it would have been a\nfractured race under any circumstance and and so a limit of three rankings there were a\nlot of ballots that didn't didn't end up counting when it got down to two but that's a\nreal outlier the the rest are usually in the sort of five to ten percent drop-off um so\nit's not necessarily a majority of the first round but it is a majority of the willing in\na sense particularly if there's not a limit on rankings of people that made a choice\nthey're having a chance to express it and and and so it's a majority of the final round\nmight not always be a majority of the first round and if anyone else wants to add on to\nthat I think that's a that's a good explanation I will say too where I and maybe Rob you\ncan speak to this the majority vast majority of races seem to have something that is 50\nplus one there are some including Minneapolis where we've had something again because of\nthe drop-off where it is less than 50 percent but still the races I have seen have been in\nthe high 40s so maybe you can speak a little bit to when we talk about plurality winner\nyou know what what does that look like in ranked choice voting yeah and it's obviously\nthere's a different different measure also of sort of what voters might be meaning like in\nthe current Minneapolis mayor the race that just happened the winner was ranked in the top\nthree out of it was 10 candidates for mayor 11 more something like that something a bunch\nof candidates and this person I think maybe even 15 or something right so ranked in the\ntop three by more than half of voters however some of those voters ranked his opponent in\nthe final round as a higher choice so he's deboused in count for him in the final choice\nbecause they were counting for someone else but those voters had made a sort of a\nexpression of interest and support for for that candidate and so if you look at that way\nyou almost always get the winners getting expressions of support for more than 50 percent\nand from in a sense from the voter perspective they made a sense feel feel represented by\nthat person to a degree right you know like like they they made an affirmative decision to\nrank them but anyway that's sort of getting in the weeds but it is sort of a way that it's\na different it's not just sort of a one-on-one thing it's a it's how you attract support\nfrom a from a community of people and certainly the candidates see it that way where they\nneed to reach out to as many people as possible so when the the new mayor of Minneapolis\nyou know got an affirmative expression of support for more than half the voters and that\nto me seems important. I can talk a little bit about it you know the I guess the\nopposition is a lack of understanding of what ranked choice voting is it's something\ndifferent it's new and it can be confusing once you start diving down into some of the\nminutia so we got that a lot we got opposition because of cost even though I think if it's\ndone correctly there's cost savings but initially you spend more money if you're going to\ndo a lot of outreach we had to buy we had to do all of our outreach we had to buy software\nto do our CV we had the additional poll workers so there was some initial expense that\nnormally wouldn't be in an election but then you know the software gets amortized over\nmultiple elections and that kind of goes away so the other thing I think that I kind of\nsaw is elected officials and I know we have some in the room so don't take this personally\nbut elected officials know how to win a certain kind of contest and now all of a sudden\nhere's a ranked choice voting contest and this is different I've never won that kind of\nelection so what do I do and so I think there's been a little bit of a learning curve\nthere are some unrealistic expectations on candidates parts I know we had one mayor in one\nof the cities who was an ardent ardent supporter of ranked choice voting because it was he\nthought it was going to save him money and running his campaign you'd only have to run one\ncampaign rather than two so he pushed it through the city and got it adopted well of\ncourse you know what happened he he lost the ranked choice voting contest and now he is an\nardent advocate to eliminate ranked choice voting and he used to send emails all the time\nsaying why did I make them do this so it was it was kind of funny to see that happen but\nso I think it's a it's really a lack of understanding sometimes about what it really means\nto win an election out of campaign so yeah and I think sorry I'll just add very quick then\nturn over Elizabeth which but I think is that one of the lessons learned in in Minneapolis\nin some ways has been a good example for for doing this which is to make sure that all the\nplayers and elections the people most involved really understand the system because if\nthey go in misinformed and then lose like Dave was mentioned earlier some people go out\nthere and say rank me first second and third thinking that helps and it doesn't help and\nand and if they find out later it didn't help and that you know it just just makes them\nfeel stupid you know and then they're more more likely to feel like they shouldn't do it\nso just making sure that the the key players understand it and then understand outcomes\nwhich is one of the things that's interesting about that Minneapolis video which is\nshowing both winners and losers sort of accepting the outcome we also had to deal with the\nsituation in these early adoptions of ranked choice voting that there wasn't a turnkey\nsolution to implementing it there would be taking over the world I think if that was going\nto happen it probably already would have with viruses which are basically nature's\nnanobots and even though it's cold and flu season viruses have not actually taken over the\nworld they are limited by their resources and they compete with each other all the\ndifferent types that are out there for those resources so even if there were nanobots out\nthere that could replicate they would be competing with one another for resources and as\nthey replicated they would change a little bit with each replication because it probably\nwouldn't be perfect so eventually you'd have all these different nanobots competing for\nthese different for these resources and as a result they would"

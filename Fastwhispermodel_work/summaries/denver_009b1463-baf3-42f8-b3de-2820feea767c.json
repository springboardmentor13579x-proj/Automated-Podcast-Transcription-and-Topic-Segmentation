what\nthis super bowl of city planning events will do to this city these six thousand planners\nevent planners that are in the city right now over the next three to five years will\naccumulate billions of dollars of travel to the city and they go home which is so nice but\nmore important than that there is a r o y that each denver property owner is paying right\nnow it's about eight hundred dollars off of your property taxes because our tourism\nindustry is so strong and robust so it's important it's in it's a it's a r ally for our\ncitizens in denver and for those of us who are looking to fund important programs for the\ncitizens who are up here it's an important revenue stream and so we can thank our branding\nagent visit denver enough for what you do ooh for this city and every

last year communities across the land have mourn dozens lost in school shootings as\nwell as the tens of thousands of men women and children lost in random homicides and\nsuicides from sea to not so shining sea cnn lists the following school shootings thus far\nin two thousand and eighteen most won't ring a bell because they don't rise to the level\nof carnage that we saw in parkland florida or

first in philadelphia january twenty third and benton\nkentucky january twenty second in italy texas in january twentieth in winston salem north\ncarolina as this year we here in denver rightfully continue to mourn the horrific losses\nat columbine and at the aurora theater shooting and how fortunate we we might think that\nwe are that these most recent shooting shootings didn't happen to us but can we be sure\nthat we were actually spared our mayor michael hancock was born in fort hood texas\ngovernor john hickenlooper came from narberth pennsylvania robin witness dean head of\ndenver health grew up on the east coast doctor rebecca chop chancellor of the university\nof denver came from rural kansas those of you in the audience please and my colleagues on\nthe deus if you'll raise your hand if you were not born in denver so lest you be comforted\nthat these recent shootings haven't torn our community apart realize that just might be an\nillusion it might have been our future governor that died in texas the other day or our\nmayor or council president or a future scientists poised to finally find a cure for some\nhideous childhood illness at the colorado children's hospital or a mould shattering police\nchief or educator or maybe just a kid who grew up to be your next door neighbor or your\nbest friend i want to thank my colleague councilman espinoza for picking up the gauntlet\nlaid down at one of our public comment sessions and putting through a bill that outlawed\nbump stocks and reduced our allowable size for high capacity magazines but there is so\nmuch much more that that must be done we watch with interest to see how the courts will\nassess boulder's recent efforts to eliminate assault weapons in their community but at the\nsame time we're very aware that the scourge of gun violence goes far d cheaper than guns\nalone we must finally make a sea change commitment to mental health care we must address\nthe winding income gap and the attendant frustration and hopelessness that shows a few\nhaving so much and so many having so little our children are becoming more and more\nfrightened with every passing week less and less sure that they are safe in their schools\ni met last week with dps security chief mike eaton to get an idea about what our public\nschool district is doing to protect our kids he spoke at great length about what the def\nutrecht is doing as far as infrastructure and process and systems and and partnership with\nthe denver police department to change the paradigm but security can only do so much to\ncontrol the deranged again we must do a better job of healing the sick re repairing the\ndamage much of what this council might want to do it is preempted by state law whereas\ni've said before we can't even create a database of gun owners it's against the law i am\nprepared to join with my colleagues mayor hancock governor hickenlooper and our state\nlegislators to again change that paradigm so that we might create a new denver a new\ncolorado where kids get in full night of peaceful rest knowing that the worst that might\nhappen to them the next day at school is a pop quiz that they weren't expecting thank you\nmr president wow thank you thank you councilman councilwoman arteaga i first want to thank\ncouncilman cashier for bringing this forward in for that very thorough overview of what\nhas become too much of a norm in this country we cannot accept this being the norm we have\nto stand and keep guns out of the hands of our children and out of the hands of criminals\nthis is just we should not have to be doing this kind of proclamation it's time across\nthis country that we all stand up and make our voices heard loud and clear on behalf of\nour children on behalf of our communities that this is not acceptable not long ago one of\nmy granddaughters was at school and they they had to shelter in place because there was\nsomebody in the neighborhood not far from here very close to downtown their school is is\nvery close to downtown where you know this person had a gun and said they wanted to make\nsure all the students were safe kids should feel comfortable and they should be safe going\nto school going to the movies going to any public place where they don't have to fear for\ntheir lives because we had too many guns on the streets in this country councilman cashman\nthank you for bringing this thank you councilman arteaga council espinoza thank you and\ncashman for not only bringing this forward but the comments you just made tonight you can\nprobably hear my voice how moved i am by by what you shared this is in context with the\nconversation ahead on on on friday anyway the the second amendment starts with four words\na well regulated militia regulated being the third work in the second amendment and if you\nhave a well regulated militia mean we do what we have is not a well regulated militia when\nyou have this many members of that that militia the people using that part of the the of\nthis provision going off and killing people indiscriminately you have a problem in your\nmilitia and so that's where the well regulated part needs to come in to effect and what's\ninteresting is then the next line mean the next part of that first sentence is being\nnecessary to the security of a free strait free state if you have to have checkpoints at\nchurches and schools and the recommendations a single entry into that location that's not\nnot a free state that is that is everything that we fought multiple wars against so there\nis just a very very serious disconnect like logging onto the right the right of people to\nbear keep and bear arms if you're not doing the first two things having a well regular\nhated militia and in maintaining a free state the security of a free state that those guns\nare not performing the function that they are that that thinking is passe it is old and i\nam glad that on friday i got to to it to be part of a panel held by skinner students lily\nrachel and ada let it let to a panel of very very capable panel where we learned about\nwhat this city in this state is doing and so the good news is is that we're making\nprogress on focusing on wellbeing i think if we there's a lot that's wrong in america that\nwe can fix and there's examples in our own past there's examples worldwide on how we can\ndo a better america and be a more perfect union and so we're moving towards it if we can\nwork on the wellbeing of the individual cover their health cover their education make sure\nthat they have all the things that they they need so that they're not reaching that point\nit probably won't matter how many guns you have but the good news is is that generation\nthose middle schoolers the ones right before the parkland high school students they're\ngetting it they're understanding that there's a very big disconnect between a very very\nvery vocal and and well funded minority in this country gloaming behind a the the fourth\nphrase and in the second amendment and skipping over the other two crucial portions and\nthey are going to be the the change agents and so the combination let's work on the well-\nbeing let's work on the individuals let's work on the community culture and environment\nthat schools are that our society is while this new and nurture a new generation that\nactually sees of a free and secure america as being one that's open and tolerant and\ncaring for one another so i mean that is what's what what we've done in the past clearly\nisn't working and the really frustrating thing is is that is that is is is depressing as\nit is hearing about school shootings over and over and over again and the the the the i\ndon't know what the total number of middle schools and high schools that were open and\nclosed on that day that didn't experience that and it's an overwhelming large number the\nkids that are going to school today are fearful and i could not shake that out of in that\nroom i just couldn't i couldn't imagine it wasn't something that i went through in high\nschool it never occurred to me that we needed to have the school resource officer and\nmetal detectors and i went to school in colorado but there were two members of that board\nthat had experienced a gun violence in colorado high schools and so it's it's a thing that\nis affecting them and until we we we we do the heavy lifting ourselves nothing's going to\nget done and until these guys get in charge and great thankfully for us there that's in my\nlifetime and i'm looking forward to thanks right councilman can each thank you mister\npresident there's little i can add to the eloquent where it says the sponsor of this\ncouncilman cashman but where there's a gap i liked it kind of jumped and witches i think\nit's really important to focus on the the school shootings because they have been such a\nvisible symptom of the disease have guns in our country but they aren't the only place\nwhere moms are losing kids and i just have to acknowledge the moms in our city who lose\nkids everyday and individual shootings and homicides and many many women in our city lose\ntheir lives at the hands of their intimate partners at the other end of a gun and so i\nworry a little bit that too much of the gun debate has moved to this realm of mass\nshooting and in some ways has has changed the debate where where whereas in talking about\nmental illness and i think you know it is important to bring more attention to mental\nillness and treatment but if we did our raising of hands of who here hasn't mental illness\nor someone in their close family who suffers for one i think many of our hands would go up\nand so i think that i am not comfortable with the way the national debate has taken the\nfocus away from guns and tried to put it on mental illness as if that is the the the the\nlethal element here it's certainly an ally i meant where we miss warning signs where we\nmiss opportunities intervene every piece of those systems should be fixed but that does\nnot replace the need to regulate guns in common sense ways to save lives and not just for\nmass shootings but for the many individuals more more individuals than councilman cashman\nread more mothers and and more lost kids who lose lose their lives in other types of gun\nviolence so i think it's just important that those families and those folks be recognized\ni don't have a list of their names but i'm worn for them as well and for them to we need\nto keep this debate focused on the regulatory side again mental health is empty portant we\nneed to talk about it but not as a substitute for controlling the lethality of guns thank\nyou all right thank you councilman lopez thank you mr president much to add except to want\nto transmit cash it those are very very well written proclamation and your comments were\nright on point one when i think of when you're speaking i was just thinking of a\nconversation i had with my daughter who is ten years old goes to school and dps and i was\njust reflecting on we were talking about tornado safety you know if a tornado hit you go\nto a hallway and you do your drills the drills that i had one on in elementary school she\ntaught me something completely different she says while we do the shelter in place\nlockdown drills and lockdown drills she says well you have to stay away from the windows\nand we gotta go hide when we gotta be quiet and i have a special job as i was your job me\nhow she says i have to make sure that the closet i have to i'm the one that has to go run\non and make sure that the closet door is open so that the classroom door does not open she\ngoes it's the real close together and it locks so nobody can come in baba i never think to\nmyself man just one of those drills with skills it's scaring the hell out of me as a kid\nimagine i mean i just imagined myself as as an elementary school in her same elementary\nschool by the way and just being scared for my life i mean tornado drills are bad as it is\nhiding under the under the desks and you know for some for some folks that are on the west\ncoast that's scary enough as it is imagine those drills for lockdowns and and imagine\ntheir reality twenty years from now their d sensitivity the ptsd is just doing that and\nhow that would affect our future or kids or society so i think about that then i then i\nsaw an update on cnn there was a number that said there have been twenty two hundred and\neighty eight school shootings since two thousand and nine which was fifty seven times more\nthan the other six g seven countries combined it's going to take a heck of a lot more and\nit's becoming cliche than just passing the buck to hopes and prayers and everybody's\nasking for action it's going to take a culture change a shift in our culture when we go to\nthe flea market while there are for boys to play with and the market erected the boys are\nthe little plastic guns olympics teens not even cowboy pea shooters man these are m\nsixteens at the at the market you go into any one of these malls in the area and you can\nbuy guns and it's not necessarily the the ones that are real bullets but they have their\nairsoft and there are replicas right so you just think about that and think about our\nculture there's so many different ways that we can change and make these shifts or\nencourages encourage other people to make these shifts and you know there are these\ncultural psyche that that that we create for our society and it's something that we can do\nyou don't have to wait on congress to do it or we don't have to wait on government whether\nit be local or state to do it right we can encourage with our dollars and if i might just\nadd something i think about growing up in the nineties and having guns pointed at you or\nbeing threatened with weapons because you add a different color on those of us who grew up\nin the nineties just knew how tough that was it was not uncommon to have a weapon in\nsomebody's locker or to have shootings outside i mean we got chased around by the vg vs\noutside of west high school with guns that culture has to shift and we can't wait for it\nto be a school shooting and we can't just talk about it in school shootings as an everyday\nthing that we have to change so and i dunno maybe this is something that we can look into\ni hate i never thought i would i come to this point or even say this publicly but i think\nit's time to start looking at metal detectors in our schools if that's if it means saving\npeople's lives are just folks my friends that have all the way all across the country that\nthey look at me weird because my high school didn't have a metal detector it so the ten\nsteps that i wish we didn't have to cross but i think we've passed that threshold a long\ntime ago so thank you councilman cashman for for bringing this topic up again i'm glad\nthat we're not just the kind of like a one and done or you know we just have one\nproclamation or one action that we forget about it i'm glad that you brought this forward\nagain thank you yeah thank you councilman lopez and thank you councilman cashman for\nbringing this for a lot to think about here and it has been moved in second in madam\nsecretary roll-call cashman i can eat lopez i knew ortega sussman black claire espinosa\nflynn i gilmore i miss president i please was the loneliness results twelve ice twelve\neyes five ninety four has been adopted counseling cash is there anybody you'd like to\nbring up yes mr president i'd like to bring up josie brady representing the colorado\ncoalition guns gun violence and today i gratefully accept that proclamation from\ncouncilman cashman on behalf of the colorado coalition against gun violence when i was\nthirteen months old columbine happened thirteen people lost their lives that day when i\nwas nine years old i was at city park jazz and i fled for my life my friends and i had to\nrun as a shooting broke out between two rival gang members five years later officers\nofficer selena hollis was killed at that same event several weeks after she was killed the\naurora theater shooting happened where twelve lives were taken the next year i was sent\nhome early from i attended east high school and i sent home early classes were cancelled\nthat day because there were threats against our school that shooting would happen and just\na few weeks ago i was working with my friends at regis university where i now attend and\nwe were working out homework in a classroom and we learned that two shooters ran onto our\ncampus from fiftieth in federal and we had to barricade the doors with our legs and we\ndidn't know what to do let's just say i didn't get my homework done that night what do\nthese all have in common well these are things that have happened in my life but i'm not\nalone i have not felt safe in my schools in my parks at my movie theaters or in my\nneighborhood fear has consumed me and many others in my generation across the country as\nof five days ago nine hundred forty three young people under the age of eighteen have been\nkilled due to gun violence in two thousand and eighteen that's under the age of eighteen\nnot even my age group that number does not include the people that have been killed for\nmany years ever since nineteen seventy when the arkansas shooting happened this number\nincludes though seventeen year old ty ty martinez who shot and killed in march at west\ncolfax and lol i initially took this fear and turned it into action i started a group at\neast high school to bring in young people to start talking about the issue and what to do\nabout it i got involved in the national level that generation progress to organize young\npeople across the country and as four years have passed our leaders have done things but\nit's not been enough we have

and do pass as amended alright it has been moved and\nseconded public hearing for three two two three three twenty three is now open may we have\nthe staff report sarah good evening i'm sarah with cpd here to present the staff report\nfor the two thousand and eighteen text amendment bundle so as you may be familiar with our\nbundles of the past and the texts memory bundle is part of our effort to keep the zoning\ncode modern clear user friendly and updated and for us to be able to respond to requests\nfor changes to the zoning code so city staff periodically reviews the code and prayer\ncritize his updates in response to customer and community feedback industry changes and\nother factors and we we try to do these bundles of texas moments roughly annually so the\nmost previous bundle was adopted last spring in april of two thousand and seventeen so the\nbundle is intended to implement several of the comprehensive two thousand plan goals to\nensure that the zoning code is flexible and accommodates the current and future land use\nneeds and it encourages quality infill development that is consistent with the character\nof the surrounding neighborhood and establishes development standards that encourage\npositive change in diversity while protecting character and identifying community design\nand development issues and target specific concerns with appropriate controls and\nincentives so the bundle allows us to respond to these types of requests as we as we get\nthem and try to keep the zoning code updated in an annual fashion so the process so far we\nstarted the scoping of this text him i met last summer and really research and drafted\nthroughout the summer and fall and then started some targeted stakeholder outreach in late\ntwo thousand and seventeen early two thousand and eighteen so even before a public review\ndraft was available we did want to start the conversation with stakeholders who may be\nimpacted by some of the changes so that we could have the conversation get the feedback\nmake any changes that were necessary as a result of that conversation we also presented to\nthe i n c zoning and planning committee for an info item in late january then on february\ntwelfth was when we released the full public red line and included the full text of the\nchanges and a summary and more plain english since these bundles tend to be a little\ndifficult to wrap your heads around this one in particular includes over eighty items that\nwas on our tex the amendment list and then when that was released there was also notice\nsent to all our nose and council members as well we did offer text amendment briefings to\nall council members during this time on february twenty first we had an info item at\nplanning board and then we also had an info item at luci on march sixth and then march\nsixteenth we had our planning board hearing so for planning board and for city council we\nhave six letters of comment for the bundle and one was in support of our mess and form\nchanges that are proposed as part of the mixed use two story districts one was in\nopposition to those same changes saying that they were inappropriate to restrict\ncommercial properties one was asking for restrictions on the location of many storage\nfacilities particularly close to downtown which is a topic that this bundle is addressing\nwas commenting on the proposed step back that is part of the two and a half story building\nforms with low sloped roofs and this was a competent planning board as well generally some\nconcerns with the number we were proposing the step-back to be addressed at one with\ngenerally various comments about all of the changes and then an additional letter that was\nsubmitted at planning board from the vision zero coalition in support of the proposed\ndrive through restrictions at planning board planning board voted seven to one to\nrecommend approval with the following conditions the first condition was that the draft\ncontinued to be edited for clarity and then the next the conditions two and three where\nstaff recommended conditions sos number two was that we clarify the applicability of some\nof the lightings standard changes and to remove changes to the maximum height for all\nfixtures so these were some things that were in the early drafts as part of the the\nlighting changes that as we talked more through them with our internal departments\nparticularly development services some concerns were brought about about how we might\nimplement some of those and in terms of inspections and that sort of thing so we clarified\nthe applicability of what types of projects would be subject to these new changes number\nthree was that saffron moves changes to the site interior setbacks for the amex mm two x\ndistricts when adjacent to protect the district so those of you who were on lydian had\nindividual briefings may remember that one of the changes we are proposing is to increase\nthe rear setback for our mx two x districts and as part of that we also made a slight\nchange to the side interior setback and we realized that that was actually inconsistent\nwith the intent of what we were proposing to do so we are leaving the side interior sat\nback as in the code currently but still proposing the increased rear setback and the\nnumber four was a condition that planning board added and it was a result of a lot of\nconversation about the comment whether the step back for the two and a half story\ndistricts was appropriate to be applied at twenty five feet or if there was a different\nnumber so planning board added the condition that staff further examining consider in\nfuture chase changes regarding possible unintended consequences of urban house ten\nfootstep back about twenty five feet and possible unintended consequences of low sloped\nroof definition and complexity of compound roof slopes so the one vote of opposition from\nplanning board was to do the fact that the planning board member did not agree with adding\nthe fourth condition it was not that he disagreed with the content of the bundle and so we\nhad three speakers at planning board to internally from the city one from denver\nenvironmental health and one from the vision zero coalition both speaking in support of\nthe drive through restrictions and how they relate to pedestrian safety and actually\nasking for for them to be expanded in the future and then the the member that also wrote\nthe letter that is included in your packet spoke about the concerns with the low-slope\nroof definition and the if the step back was proposed at the correct number and as you'll\nsee in your packet he wrote a follow up letter after planning board that conceded that the\nthe twenty five the foot was was an appropriate number to apply the step back at after\nplanning board city council had the loony committee on april tenth which was a consent\nagenda item on first reading was the nineteenth and we are at our public hearing tonight\njust a reminder that the bundle is proposed to have a roughly six month grace period for\nprojects that have been submitted before the effective date to align with the end of the\nslot homes grace period which is why i say roughly six months since slot home since\nadopted about two weeks ago and we wanted to align the end of the grace period with their\ngrace period so that our development services staff didn't have to juggle multiple\ndeadlines and the reason for the grace period is similar to slot homes in that there would\nbe some pretty significant impacts to projects that have already put a lot of time and\neffort and investment into submittals and we wanted to give them some time to finish up so\nbecause of the process that we've had so far and the fact that we had individual council\nbriefings and we did have an info item for the loot committee i'm not going to go into the\ndetails of all eighty items that are proposed as part of the bundle those are detailed in\nyour packet but what i am going to do tonight is i'm going to go through some of the\nchanges that have a occurred since you would have heard about it at a briefing or lucci so\nwe continued to correct any errors in translations continue to improve graphics cross\nreferences clarification all of those things that the bundle is great for related to the\nmini storage and drive through restrictions in sms and downtown zone districts and near\nrail stations so this is not so one thing that has changed so we did decide to continue to\npropose that many storage be not allowed within a quarter mile of rail unless you're in an\nindustrial zone district and four drive throughs within a quarter mile of rail to not be\nallowed unless you're in a suburbans one district with some additional restrictions just\nwanted to highlight this bill because this topic by far has gotten the most conversation\nout of anything in the bundle and we've heard a lot of this is great it should go further\nwe should apply it to more areas of the city but we've also heard some this might be a\nlittle bit of an overstep we want to make sure that we're supporting our density and our\nsmall units and giving them pay places to store their stuff and so we really think that\nthe proposal as is in the bundle is a really good first step for treating these we have\nheard a lot that we'd like that there are people who would like to see this potentially\nexpanded to transit corridors or all corridors are all mixed use zoning which is a really\nlarge imp fact on the city transit corridors the reason that we didn't include them as\npart of this is because there's there's a lot less policy surrounding our transit\ncorridors right now there's a lot of planning going on particularly with the denver moves\nplan so as as that infrastructure fills and and as planning and policy kind of is\nsolidified around those areas i think there's definitely room to consider something\nfurther but for now we are remaining with the rail station quarter mile buffer and the\ndowntown zone district changes as i mentioned earlier we are still proposing to increase\nthe rear setback in r m s and m x two x districts when there are adjacent to protect the\ndistrict's annual reminder the reason for this is because the zone districts are intended\nto be embedded in residential areas surrounded by urban houses and duplexes that they\nreally should refer the fact that character that they're intended to be placed in and not\nbe allowed to build to the zero lot line and have a really large hulking structure and so\nas i said there was just a minor change that was proposed in addition to the rear setback\nfor the site interior setback we had proposed to increase that but then we when we looked\nat it again we realized that that was actually inconsistent with the urban how standards\nwhich is what we were basing it off of so we decided to keep that that standard at five\nfeet and then some more of the the little shifts that we've done we are still adding some\nstandards to parking lot lighting we're adding maximum illumination levels for certain\nuses were met adding uniformity ratios for safety and some of the things that we have\nchanged a little bit since we talked with you earlier was some additional clarification on\nwhat projects would be applicable to these changes so basically that projects that are\nsubmitted from here on out will be required to comply with these and not necessarily\nprojects that are already built because that would be really difficult for our inspections\nto enforce and then we had also proposed a mounting height limitation for fixtures on\nthere is already mounting height limitation for free standing lights in the zoning code\nand we were proposing to apply that to all all lights but we realize that that could have\nsome unintended consequences it would prevent someone from having a patio light on their\nthird floor apartment that sort of thing so that's something that we'd like to look at a\nlittle further this is an additional topic that we've had a lot of conversation about\nthrough this bundle process and again this is kind of a first step for some lighting\nchanges to our code code our code doesn't have a lot of lighting standards right now so we\nwant to kind of start with the worst of it and continue to evaluate that through future\nbundle changes and such and then for the two and a half story forms at the low sloped roof\nwe are proposing a ten foot step back above twenty five feet to essentially break up the\nmass of a building from the street so you probably are aware that are two and a half story\nbuilding form can result in something that really appears to be three stories which is\nreally out of context with a lot of what's built in the neighborhoods so this step back\nabove twenty five feet is intended to make the building appear to be more consistent with\ngenerally the two stories that it's it's built around and this is what planning board had\na lot of discussion about based on mister farley's comment asking whether the twenty five\nfeet was the right standard and if there are other things that we hadn't considered as\npart of this so we did study that number more and we did come to the conclusion that\ntwenty five feet is the appropriate height to apply to step back at and we also got the\nfollow up letter from mr varley agreeing but we did actually use the unintended\nconsequences a portion of the planning board recommendation to consider and add the\naddition of an administrative adjustment for historic structures for this step back and so\nin our code we already have allowed administrative adjustments for bulk and height for\nhistoric structures and since this is a bulk related item it was brought to our attention\nby the curtis park neighborhood that this could have some pretty large effects on the\nhistoric character by requiring the step back and so because in historic districts there\nis an additional level of review there's the design standards there's ltd rb or lpc that\nhas to make these decisions we were comfortable adding an administrative adjustment that\nwould allow with the approval of the landmark commission to get out of this step back in\nhistoric districts or historic structures so moving on to the criteria that we use to\naddress text moments on the first is consistency with the city's adopted plans and\npolicies the first is comprehensive plan two thousand which i went over a little earlier\nhow the reason the bundle is consistent with adopt a comp plan including requiring infill\ndevelopment to be consistent we've done a lot in this bundle about consistent infill and\nbulk and mass and then blueprint denver we have language in there that says amendments are\nrecommended to implement adopted plans and improve compatibility with existing plans as\nwell as revised standards to make existing zone districts more compatible which is what a\nlot of these mass inform changes are doing and it furthers the public health safety and\ngeneral welfare by providing clarity and predictability by facilitating planned and\ndesired private enterprise and redevelopment and it continues to implement adopted plans\nthrough regulatory changes and it results in regulations that are uniform on the\namendments regulations are uniform in their application to buildings and land uses within\neach zone districts citywide and it improves greater consistency in zoning regulations and\nremoves conflicting provisions which improves our ability to administer and enforce the\ncode uniformly so with that iowa staff does recommend that the city council approve the\ntext moment twenty eighteen bundle i am happy to answer any questions and talk about any\nof the topics in the bundle especially since we didn't go into the details in the staff\nreport thanks great thank you sir alright we have three speakers this evening i'm gonna\nask them to come to the f front we have joe noble jesse paris and chairman si cu joe\neurope first three minutes good evening council my name is joel noble a little bit to\nseven zero five stout street first i just want to say these these bundles are one of my\nfavorite things this is owning geek because i get exposed to so many of the things that\nended up needing tweaked whether hear about it through neighborhood organizations or comes\nthrough planning board or here about something go through going through the board of\nadjustment for zoning appeals that it's it's always great when it's some time later it\ntakes a little bit of time you see a fixed propose that's been studied and carefully\nconsidered and you say oh that's great i knew that didn't work right i was carrying that\naround with me and now i know it's getting solved john hayden prisoners of curtis park\nneighbors sent a letter to council copying cpd last week thanking cpd for the work on one\npiece here which is a change to the administrative adjustment table and he asked that i\nspeak on on behalf of curtis park neighbors tonight as an advisory board member just\nconveying or thanks curtis park and perhaps other historic neighborhoods from the same era\ntend to be tend to have houses that are narrow and tall and this new upper storey step\nback for low sloped roofs like italian eight structures would require them would actually\nprevent them from being as tall as they normally are or when we have infill in our\nneighborhood that infill should fit in if if a house is built strictly to the zoning code\nit would look quite small compared to the historic context today we depend entirely on\nadministrative adjustment which is a great little escape clause in the zoning code that\nsays the zoning administrator may within certain limits allow some dimensions to be\nexceeded or modified in order to fit the context better if it's beyond that limited\nallowance that needs to go for variance but within within bounds and that works very very\nwell we go through landmark review because they're a landmark district and then whatever\nor administrative adjustments are needed i have never been denied this new measurement was\nnot available for administrative adjustment so that that meant that any infill housing in\ncurtis park that is as tall as our normal housing is or is our context i would have to go\nall the way for a variance which isn't expensive link the and uncertain process and when\nwhen we made that case to cpd they knew exactly what we were talking about they never\nreact quickly they want to always want to go away study came back within a few days and\nsaid okay this narrow allowance on the administrative adjustment table where you're in a\nlandmark district and landmark irc has reviewed it is the minimum necessary to to meet\nyour concerns and in fact it is so thank you to sarah and thank you to kyle dalton and\njennifer beto we're thrilled to see this go forward alright thank you mr noble jesse paris\nyou're up three minutes good evening members of council when i'm jesse pairs my twenty\neight forty two joseph finish street and brooks district nine my question is i'm neither\nfor i'm neither for nor against this i just need clarification on what is a protected\ndistrict is that the same thing as a historical districts what is urban how standards and\nis this in any way going to increase the already gentrification that is going on in the\ncurtis park neighborhood it seems like you guys will just give them leeway to\ngentrification and historically black and brown communities i just need clarification that\nthis build and bundle is not going to do facilitate that further thank you alright thank\nyou chairman sekou six minutes okay here we go my insurance a coup to organize a black\nsocial movements social change agency voice for the poor working poor homeless senior\ncitizens and or youth this bundling to pool all of these seemingly minor pieces that are\nconnected to each other is a good idea on this anytime you can find common ground with\neighty different minor entities and combined them into one big thing is part of\nadministration and of course a lot of thought meetings and explanations that we don't have\nto go through here and just bought it today because the work has been done by planet but\nnow let's look at pulling the layers back of the onion to get to the core about what is\nreally driving and what are the values behind this thing that allows us to miss fours for\ntreats we've got the treason and it's a big thing what's really driving this thing was\nreally trying and that becomes the question for the people because when you do this\nbundling thing when you combine all of these things that you do early and images into one\nvote and then that one vote there are hundreds of millions of dollars gone taxpayers'\nmoney watching this on tv because it means we'll organize at a time with rush hour traffic\njack that can come down here so they get it after the fact and so one of the things we do\nwith this process is to allow it to become educational process for the people who can be\nat the meeting for further review understanding that there's a timeframe that folks got\nthirty sixty days whatever that is to actually implement a change now for vulnerable\ncommunities that's not possible because the people are caught up especially the folks that\ni represent into day to day survival how am i going to pay my rent what am i gonna do\nabout my kids going to school hungry how am i going to do this thing when the food bank is\ngone and i eat transportation crazy i don't have that amount of money to ride the bus so i\ngotta figure out moscow to i can walk to where i got to go let's see caught up in that\nminutia we don't have time to look at the overview about hey man what are they planning\nfor you now that's going to impact your future and then the outreach doesn't include the\nfuture for education processes and to gain them into a better position of being great\ncitizens added in a great city you had no outreach two high school's student comes great\nway to educate him about what we can really do to you so the outreach has to be expanded\ninto student government assistance and university ecologist who are preparing themselves\nto be a part of this not in it because you a it to our nose and due to do but the people\nin the future the you are not included in the outreach so why not invite them to the\nmeeting or had the meeting at a high school where they're at how about a meeting two on a\ncollege campus where they're at see and now we're talking about expanding democracy and\ngetting more folks involved in the participation of the future because it's the students\nand the youth which are the future right now and their voices need to be done right now so\nthey understand what is light industrial has any as you blow past it on the reading they\ndon't know about none of that and change it from this to that they don't even have a bill\neven know what this is right now but we miss a golden opportunity to prepare the future\nleadership to our outrage that can be expanded sea salt the juice has to be included in\nthis thing because they're the ones who are going to be sitting up here because at one\npoint always youth what you learn about this and you're adult how about if you knew this\nnow what kind of adult citizens would that be outstanding so in this process of having\nteam work to make the dream work the dream is about now and it's about the future and is\nabout children is about increasing this empty chamber full of kids who want to come down\nhere and learn how to do this thing on the taxpayers' dollars because they're the\ntaxpayers that are going to be paying for the future things that are happening at least we\ncan do is educate them now in this day so thank you thank you very much this concludes our\nthree speakers for this evening are there any questions by members of council councilman\nortega thank you mr president i do have a question about the two and a half story step\nback and what i'm trying to understand is if that is only applicable to the residential\nzones and is it specific to historic districts or is it help just helped me understand how\nbroadly that is applied share so it is applicable to all of our two and a half storey\nresidential building forms and generally in our mixed use districts we don't have the two\nand a half story building forms because the height limits are higher and so it's going to\nbe your urban house your duplex your two and a half story rowhouse across sport okay so\nwhere the code formerly allowed like half of a third story does this remove that helped me\nunderstand what that so i'll clarify what the half story is because it's not really a half\nstory essentially what it is is it's a third story that's allowed to be no greater than\nseventy five percent of the floor below it and what that was intended to do i may have\nslide here so this slide this image on this slide on the top is from the zoning code and\nit was really what the half story was intended to do when you have the traditional house\nwith the sloped roof and it's two stories you have that space under the sloped roof that's\ntechnically would be considered a third story and we wanted to allow it to be used as\nlivable space so we called that a half story when it's really seventy five percent of the\nfloor below it's a third story and you can see that this is a photo example of infill that\nhas used that and you can see it's generally pretty in scale with surrounding but\nessentially what's been happening is people take that allowance and when you use a flat\nroofed form or as we're redefining in the bundle low slope and you push it to the front of\nthe building it really looks like a full three stories and you can see it towering over\nthe the surrounding infill development and to what this is intended to do do is to push\nback that third story we haven't made any changes to the allowance of how much of it but\nit's possible that there will be less allow for allowed flour area if they can't get that\nfull seventy five percent after having to to step it back ten feet from the front of the\nbuilding okay that's very helpful thank you i have no further questions thank you\ncouncilwoman against one espinoza do you want to take a stab at explaining what a\nprotected district is chirp and so a protected district is essentially in practice a low\nscale residential district we have a definition in the code it's got a list of oliver's\none districts that are considered protected districts it's all of our single unit\ndistricts oliver two unit districts i think all of our own house districts and one multi\nunit district the m u two and a half and what that means is when you have a mixed use zone\ndistrict adjacent to something that's considered a protected district things that are\nbuilt on that lot have to comply with additional standards usually it's additional\nsetbacks or additional bulk playing that sort of thing to protect the character of the low\nscale residential that it's adjacent to but the disc we're only talking about the mapped\ndistrict the the the the physical map district it doesn't it's it doesn't matter whether\nor not the building is a low scale residential building that's correct alright hope that\nhelps thanks thank you no further questions okay thank you seeing no other questions this\nconcludes the public hearing of three twenty three comments by maria's account so doctor\nsays thank you mr president i just want to thank the cpd and the planning board for the\nwork that you did on this bundle and while it is a lot of things that really dives into\nthings that we have had some concerns about that we hear about it committee they will hear\nabout some neighbors who are worried about construction going on next door thanks for the\nexplanation of the two point five because i too was thinking he's really seventy five\npercent of the top but if they can't get the ten foot setback it may not be so ninety five\npercent of the top of it right ok and also for in you know increasing the setbacks but but\nspecially for the storage units many stores and i think i have to thank my fellow\ncouncilwoman kendra black who also brought this forwards that this is a very good move i\nthink to help us with getting activation around areas of transit and mainstreet thank you\nalright thank you dr sussman counsel in black want to thank sarah you are really great and\nwith the t o d limiting the storage and the drive throughs i wanted to go a little further\nbut i acknowledge it's a good first step and i appreciate you reaching out to the storage\nunit as well association we met with them and they were okay with it and the drive through\npeople never got back to us so i really appreciate it my district has five light rail\nstations and a lot of storage facilities and we don't want to have anywhere near our light\nrail station so thank you very much alright thank you councilman black espinosa becomes\none of smoke is there a drive through association i also wanted to thank you again sarah\nand staff or another text amendment it's always nice to see these changes i don't think i\ngeek out as much as joel does but it is fun to see incremental change to our zoning code\nand the one thing that i you made it very clear that you're you're you're cognizant there\nmight be unintended consequences and you're sort of recognizing that there's still the\nability for things you haven't considered come about and i think in in an earlier\npresentation that sort of opined where i saw the sort of something breaking down and the\nso i'm going to go back to something i said i think two or three meter months ago which is\nis if staff is is seen that speak up and let the zoning administrator know that there is\nthis repeated incidents happening that may not warrant a you may rise to an occasion where\nyou're not following the usual text amendment but then bringing it to grab you can even\nhaving him move forward with a quick change it it'll still be a public process we will\nstill have the ability to discuss it but let's not wait for repeated sort of habitual\npattern to form and and get so deliberative in if we are already recognizing that one\nchange we've made has unintended consequences that could be addressed maybe by coupling\nwarm standard with a use exception or something like that you know so that's all just\nwanted to make sure that i'm probably going to keep hitting that point time and time again\nnow because it's sort of my one thing is how do we more rapidly address things that go\nsouth when when we know better so that's it thanks alright thank you thank you all thank\nyou cpd for for putting this forward and you know i think you guys are are starting to\nadjust and i'm in issues that we're seeing all over the city and really appreciate that\neveryone does low speed and we want this to be faster but at the same time i i don't want\nto say but we want it faster we want more speed let's just leave a period there i will\nalso say that i recognize the macro changes that were happening about this the city and\nthese until ten o'clock consequences have happened in my district they've happened in\nother districts and and i understand those are sometimes irreversible and so i appreciate\nit but as long as we can figure out how to churn a little faster on some of these things\nit will be very helpful to folks you see up here or on the front front lines of dealing\nwith a lot of our yet land use issues and we're getting we have a lot of idea does and so\ndo we want to see those things move but thank you for your heart work and notes very\ndeliberative we appreciate it with that madam secretary it's been moved and seconded roll\ncall black clerk or spinoza i flynn i cashman i can eat lopez ortega session mr president\ni

up here they're looking\nfor fees and all kind of things to to begin to fund housing and and rose and things like\nthat and i always find it interesting that the city leaders never look at tourism what\nthis super bowl of city planning events will do to this city these six thousand planners\nevent planners that are in the city right now over the next three to five years will\naccumulate billions of dollars of travel to the city and they go home which is so nice but\nmore important than that there is a r o y that each denver property owner is paying right\nnow it's about eight hundred dollars off of your property taxes because our tourism\nindustry is so strong and robust so it's important it's in it's a it's a r ally for our\ncitizens in denver and for those of us who are looking to fund important programs for the\ncitizens who are up here it's an important revenue stream and so we can thank our branding\nagent visit denver enough for what you do ooh for this city and every hotel room downtown\nis filled to capacity right now and around downtown and and those that lodgers tax and all\nthat stuff is coming to benefit you the citizens and so i think it's really important that\nwe understand that so i want to thank my colleague for bringing this proclamation forward\nand i want to say to the six thousand event planners have a good time endeavor go home and\nbring another six thousand folks to invest in our city all right madam secretary roll-call\nsussman high black eye clerk by espinosa espinosa i i flynn i gilmore cashman kenny lopez\nnew ortega mr president

horrific events and whereas research indicates\nthere have been more lives lost from gunfire in america than in all the wars in which us\ntroops have been any gauge since our nation's founding whereas protecting safety in the\ncommunities they serve is a city council's highest responsibility and whereas in january\ntwo thousand and thirteen a diet pendleton the teacher who marched in president

americans whose lives are cut short and the countless survivors who are injured by\nshootings every day a national coalition of organizations designated the first friday in\njune as the fourth

first in philadelphia january twenty third and benton\nkentucky january twenty second in italy texas in january twentieth in winston salem north\ncarolina as this year we here in denver rightfully continue to mourn the horrific losses\nat columbine and at the aurora theater shooting and how fortunate we we might think that\nwe are that these most recent shooting shootings didn't happen to us but can we be sure\nthat we were actually spared our mayor michael hancock was born in fort hood texas\ngovernor john hickenlooper came from narberth pennsylvania robin witness dean head of\ndenver health grew up on the east coast doctor rebecca chop chancellor of the university\nof denver came from rural kansas those of you in the audience please and my colleagues on\nthe deus if you'll raise your hand if you were not born in denver so lest you be comforted\nthat these recent shootings haven't torn our community apart realize that just might be an\nillusion it might have been our future governor that died in texas the other day or our\nmayor or council president or a future scientists poised to finally find a cure for some\nhideous childhood illness at the colorado children's hospital or a mould shattering police\nchief or educator or maybe just a kid who grew up to be your next door neighbor or your\nbest friend i want to thank my colleague councilman espinoza for picking up the gauntlet\nlaid down at one of our public comment sessions and putting through a bill that outlawed\nbump stocks and reduced our allowable size for high capacity magazines but there is so\nmuch much more that that must be done we watch with interest to see how the courts will\nassess boulder's recent efforts to eliminate assault weapons in their community but at the\nsame time we're very aware that the scourge of gun violence goes far d cheaper than guns\nalone we must finally make a sea change commitment to mental health care we must address\nthe winding income gap and the attendant frustration and hopelessness that shows a few\nhaving so much and so many having so little our children are becoming more and more\nfrightened with every passing week less and less sure that they are safe in their schools\ni met last week with dps security chief mike eaton to get an idea about what our public\nschool district is doing to protect our kids he spoke at great length about what the def\nutrecht is doing as far as infrastructure and process and systems and and partnership with\nthe denver police department to change the paradigm but security can only do so much to\ncontrol the deranged again we must do a better job of healing the sick re repairing the\ndamage much of what this council might want to do it is preempted by state law whereas\ni've said before we can't even create a database of gun owners it's against the law i am\nprepared to join with my colleagues mayor hancock governor hickenlooper and our state\nlegislators to again change that paradigm so that we might create a new denver a new\ncolorado where kids get in full night of peaceful rest knowing that the worst that might\nhappen to them the next day at school is a pop quiz that they weren't expecting thank you\nmr president wow thank you thank you councilman councilwoman arteaga i first want to thank\ncouncilman cashier for bringing this forward in for that very thorough overview of what\nhas become too much of a norm in this country we cannot accept this being the norm we have\nto stand and keep guns out of the hands of our children and out of the hands of criminals\nthis is just we should not have to be doing this kind of proclamation it's time across\nthis country that we all stand up and make our voices heard loud and clear on behalf of\nour children on behalf of our communities that this is not acceptable not long ago one of\nmy granddaughters was at school and they they had to shelter in place because there was\nsomebody in the neighborhood not far from here very close to downtown their school is is\nvery close to downtown where you know this person had a gun and said they wanted to make\nsure all the students were safe kids should feel comfortable and they should be safe going\nto school going to the movies going to any public place where they don't have to fear for\ntheir lives because we had too many guns on the streets in this country councilman cashman\nthank you for bringing this thank you councilman arteaga council espinoza thank you and\ncashman for not only bringing this forward but the comments you just made tonight you can\nprobably hear my voice how moved i am by by what you shared this is in context with the\nconversation ahead on on on friday anyway the the second amendment starts with four words\na well regulated militia regulated being the third work in the second amendment and if you\nhave a well regulated militia mean we do what we have is not a well regulated militia when\nyou have this many members of that that militia the people using that part of the the of\nthis provision going off and killing people indiscriminately you have a problem in your\nmilitia and so that's where the well regulated part needs to come in to effect and what's\ninteresting is then the next line mean the next part of that first sentence is being\nnecessary to the security of a free strait free state if you have to have checkpoints at\nchurches and schools and the recommendations a single entry into that location that's not\nnot a free state that is that is everything that we fought multiple wars against so there\nis just a very very serious disconnect like logging onto the right the right of people to\nbear keep and bear arms if you're not doing the first two things having a well regular\nhated militia and in maintaining a free state the security of a free state that those guns\nare not performing the function that they are that that thinking is passe it is old and i\nam glad that on friday i got to to it to be part of a panel held by skinner students lily\nrachel and ada let it let to a panel of very very capable panel where we learned about\nwhat this city in this state is doing and so the good news is is that we're making\nprogress on focusing on wellbeing i think if we there's a lot that's wrong in america that\nwe can fix and there's examples in our own past there's examples worldwide on how we can\ndo a better america and be a more perfect union and so we're moving towards it if we can\nwork on the wellbeing of the individual cover their health cover their education make sure\nthat they have all the things that they they need so that they're not reaching that point\nit probably won't matter how many guns you have but the good news is is that generation\nthose middle schoolers the ones right before the parkland high school students they're\ngetting it they're understanding that there's a very big disconnect between a very very\nvery vocal and and well funded minority in this country gloaming behind a the the fourth\nphrase and in the second amendment and skipping over the other two crucial portions and\nthey are going to be the the change agents and so the combination let's work on the well-\nbeing let's work on the individuals let's work on the community culture and environment\nthat schools are that our society is while this new and nurture a new generation that\nactually sees of a free and secure america as being one that's open and tolerant and\ncaring for one another so i mean that is what's what what we've done in the past clearly\nisn't working and the really frustrating thing is is that is that is is is depressing as\nit is hearing about school shootings over and over and over again and the the the the i\ndon't know what the total number of middle schools and high schools that were open and\nclosed on that day that didn't experience that and it's an overwhelming large number the\nkids that are going to school today are fearful and i could not shake that out of in that\nroom i just couldn't i couldn't imagine it wasn't something that i went through in high\nschool it never occurred to me that we needed to have the school resource officer and\nmetal detectors and i went to school in colorado but there were two members of that board\nthat had experienced a gun violence in colorado high schools and so it's it's a thing that\nis affecting them and until we we we we do the heavy lifting ourselves nothing's going to\nget done and until these guys get in charge and great thankfully for us there that's in my\nlifetime and i'm looking forward to thanks right councilman can each thank you mister\npresident there's little i can add to the eloquent where it says the sponsor of this\ncouncilman cashman but where there's a gap i liked it kind of jumped and witches i think\nit's really important to focus on the the school shootings because they have been such a\nvisible symptom of the disease have guns in our country but they aren't the only place\nwhere moms are losing kids and i just have to acknowledge the moms in our city who lose\nkids everyday and individual shootings and homicides and many many women in our city lose\ntheir lives at the hands of their intimate partners at the other end of a gun and so i\nworry a little bit that too much of the gun debate has moved to this realm of mass\nshooting and in some ways has has changed the debate where where whereas in talking about\nmental illness and i think you know it is important to bring more attention to mental\nillness and treatment but if we did our raising of hands of who here hasn't mental illness\nor someone in their close family who suffers for one i think many of our hands would go up\nand so i think that i am not comfortable with the way the national debate has taken the\nfocus away from guns and tried to put it on mental illness as if that is the the the the\nlethal element here it's certainly an ally i meant where we miss warning signs where we\nmiss opportunities intervene every piece of those systems should be fixed but that does\nnot replace the need to regulate guns in common sense ways to save lives and not just for\nmass shootings but for the many individuals more more individuals than councilman cashman\nread more mothers and and more lost kids who lose lose their lives in other types of gun\nviolence so i think it's just important that those families and those folks be recognized\ni don't have a list of their names but i'm worn for them as well and for them to we need\nto keep this debate focused on the regulatory side again mental health is empty portant we\nneed to talk about it but not as a substitute for controlling the lethality of guns thank\nyou all right thank you councilman lopez thank you mr president much to add except to want\nto transmit cash it those are very very well written proclamation and your comments were\nright on point one when i think of when you're speaking i was just thinking of a\nconversation i had with my daughter who is ten years old goes to school and dps and i was\njust reflecting on we were talking about tornado safety you know if a tornado hit you go\nto a hallway and you do your drills the drills that i had one on in elementary school she\ntaught me something completely different she says while we do the shelter in place\nlockdown drills and lockdown drills she says well you have to stay away from the windows\nand we gotta go hide when we gotta be quiet and i have a special job as i was your job me\nhow she says i have to make sure that the closet i have to i'm the one that has to go run\non and make sure that the closet door is open so that the classroom door does not open she\ngoes it's the real close together and it locks so nobody can come in baba i never think to\nmyself man just one of those drills with skills it's scaring the hell out of me as a kid\nimagine i mean i just imagined myself as as an elementary school in her same elementary\nschool by the way and just being scared for my life i mean tornado drills are bad as it is\nhiding under the under the desks and you know for some for some folks that are on the west\ncoast that's scary enough as it is imagine those drills for lockdowns and and imagine\ntheir reality twenty years from now their d sensitivity the ptsd is just doing that and\nhow that would affect our future or kids or society so i think about that then i then i\nsaw an update on cnn there was a number that said there have been twenty two hundred and\neighty eight school shootings since two thousand and nine which was fifty seven times more\nthan the other six g seven countries combined it's going to take a heck of a lot more and\nit's becoming cliche than just passing the buck to hopes and prayers and everybody's\nasking for action it's going to take a culture change a shift in our culture when we go to\nthe flea market while there are for boys to play with and the market erected the boys are\nthe little plastic guns olympics teens not even cowboy pea shooters man these are m\nsixteens at the at the market you go into any one of these malls in the area and you can\nbuy guns and it's not necessarily the the ones that are real bullets but they have their\nairsoft and there are replicas right so you just think about that and think about our\nculture there's so many different ways that we can change and make these shifts or\nencourages encourage other people to make these shifts and you know there are these\ncultural psyche that that that we create for our society and it's something that we can do\nyou don't have to wait on congress to do it or we don't have to wait on government whether\nit be local or state to do it right we can encourage with our dollars and if i might just\nadd something i think about growing up in the nineties and having guns pointed at you or\nbeing threatened with weapons because you add a different color on those of us who grew up\nin the nineties just knew how tough that was it was not uncommon to have a weapon in\nsomebody's locker or to have shootings outside i mean we got chased around by the vg vs\noutside of west high school with guns that culture has to shift and we can't wait for it\nto be a school shooting and we can't just talk about it in school shootings as an everyday\nthing that we have to change so and i dunno maybe this is something that we can look into\ni hate i never thought i would i come to this point or even say this publicly but i think\nit's time to start looking at metal detectors in our schools if that's if it means saving\npeople's lives are just folks my friends that have all the way all across the country that\nthey look at me weird because my high school didn't have a metal detector it so the ten\nsteps that i wish we didn't have to cross but i think we've passed that threshold a long\ntime ago so thank you councilman cashman for for bringing this topic up again i'm glad\nthat we're not just the kind of like a one and done or you know we just have one\nproclamation or one action that we forget about it i'm glad that you brought this forward\nagain thank you yeah thank you councilman lopez and thank you councilman cashman for\nbringing this for a lot to think about here and it has been moved in second in madam\nsecretary roll-call cashman i can eat lopez

got involved in the national level that generation progress to organize young\npeople across the country and as four years have passed our leaders have done things but\nit's not been enough we have

and do pass as amended alright it has been moved and\nseconded public hearing for three two two three three twenty three is now open may we have\nthe staff report sarah good evening i'm sarah with cpd here to present the staff report\nfor the two thousand and eighteen text amendment bundle so as you may be familiar with our\nbundles of the past and the texts memory bundle is part of our effort to keep the zoning\ncode modern clear user friendly and updated and for us to be able to respond to requests\nfor changes to the zoning code so city staff periodically reviews the code and prayer\ncritize his updates in response to customer and community feedback industry changes and\nother factors and we we try to do these bundles of texas moments roughly annually so the\nmost previous bundle was adopted last spring in april of two thousand and seventeen so the\nbundle is intended to implement several of the comprehensive two thousand plan goals to\nensure that the zoning code is flexible and accommodates the current and future land use\nneeds and it encourages quality infill development that is consistent with the character\nof the surrounding neighborhood and establishes development standards that encourage\npositive change in diversity while protecting character and identifying community design\nand development issues and target specific concerns with appropriate controls and\nincentives so the bundle allows us to respond to these types of requests as we as we get\nthem and try to keep the zoning code updated in an annual fashion so the process so far we\nstarted the scoping of this text him i met last summer and really research and drafted\nthroughout the summer and fall and then started some targeted stakeholder outreach in late\ntwo thousand and seventeen early two thousand and eighteen so even before a public review\ndraft was available we did want to start the conversation with stakeholders who may be\nimpacted by some of the changes so that we could have the conversation get the feedback\nmake any changes that were necessary as a result of that conversation we also presented to\nthe i n c zoning and planning committee for an info item in late january then on february\ntwelfth was when we released the full public red line and included the full text of the\nchanges and a summary and more plain english since these bundles tend to be a little\ndifficult to wrap your heads around this one in particular includes over eighty items that\nwas on our tex the amendment list and then when that was released there was also notice\nsent to all our nose and council members as well we did offer text amendment briefings to\nall council members during this time on february twenty first we had an info item at\nplanning board and then we also had an info item at luci on march sixth and then march\nsixteenth we had our planning board hearing so for planning board and for city council we\nhave six letters of comment for the bundle and one was in support of our mess and form\nchanges that are proposed as part of the mixed use two story districts one was in\nopposition to those same changes saying that they were inappropriate to restrict\ncommercial properties one was asking for restrictions on the location of many storage\nfacilities particularly close to downtown which is a topic that this bundle is addressing\nwas commenting on the proposed step back that is part of the two and a half story building\nforms with low sloped roofs and this was a competent planning board as well generally some\nconcerns with the number we were proposing the step-back to be addressed at one with\ngenerally various comments about all of the changes and then an additional letter that was\nsubmitted at planning board from the vision zero coalition in support of the proposed\ndrive through restrictions at planning board planning board voted seven to one to\nrecommend approval with the following conditions the first condition was that the draft\ncontinued to be edited for clarity and then the next the conditions two and three where\nstaff recommended conditions sos number two was that we clarify the applicability of some\nof the lightings standard changes and to remove changes to the maximum height for all\nfixtures so these were some things that were in the early drafts as part of the the\nlighting changes that as we talked more through them with our internal departments\nparticularly development services some concerns were brought about about how we might\nimplement some of those and in terms of inspections and that sort of thing so we clarified\nthe applicability of what types of projects would be subject to these new changes number\nthree was that saffron moves changes to the site interior setbacks for the amex mm two x\ndistricts when adjacent to protect the district so those of you who were on lydian had\nindividual briefings may remember that one of the changes we are proposing is to increase\nthe rear setback for our mx two x districts and as part of that we also made a slight\nchange to the side interior setback and we realized that that was actually inconsistent\nwith the intent of what we were proposing to do so we are leaving the side interior sat\nback as in the code currently but still proposing the increased rear setback and the\nnumber four was a condition that planning board added and it was a result of a lot of\nconversation about the comment whether the step back for the two and a half story\ndistricts was appropriate to be applied at twenty five feet or if there was a different\nnumber so planning board added the condition that staff further examining consider in\nfuture chase changes regarding possible unintended consequences of urban house ten\nfootstep back about twenty five feet and possible unintended consequences of low sloped\nroof definition and complexity of compound roof slopes so the one vote of opposition from\nplanning board was to do the fact that the planning board member did not agree with adding\nthe fourth condition it was not that he disagreed with the content of the bundle and so we\nhad three speakers at planning board to internally from the city one from denver\nenvironmental health and one from the vision zero coalition both speaking in support of\nthe drive through restrictions and how they relate to pedestrian safety and actually\nasking for for them to be expanded in the future and then the the member that also wrote\nthe letter that is included in your packet spoke about the concerns with the low-slope\nroof definition and the if the step back was proposed at the correct number and as you'll\nsee in your packet he wrote a follow up letter after planning board that conceded that the\nthe twenty five the foot was was an appropriate number to apply the step back at after\nplanning board city council had the loony committee on april tenth which was a consent\nagenda item on first reading was the nineteenth and we are at our public hearing tonight\njust a reminder that the bundle is proposed to have a roughly six month grace period for\nprojects that have been submitted before the effective date to align with the end of the\nslot homes grace period which is why i say roughly six months since slot home since\nadopted about two weeks ago and we wanted to align the end of the grace period with their\ngrace period so that our development services staff didn't have to juggle multiple\ndeadlines and the reason for the grace period is similar to slot homes in that there would\nbe some pretty significant impacts to projects that have already put a lot of time and\neffort and investment into submittals and we wanted to give them some time to finish up so\nbecause of the process that we've had so far and the fact that we had individual council\nbriefings and we did have an info item for the loot committee i'm not going to go into the\ndetails of all eighty items that are proposed as part of the bundle those are detailed in\nyour packet but what i am going to do tonight is i'm going to go through some of the\nchanges that have a occurred since you would have heard about it at a briefing or lucci so\nwe continued to correct any errors in translations continue to improve graphics cross\nreferences clarification all of those things that the bundle is great for related to the\nmini storage and drive through restrictions in sms and downtown zone districts and near\nrail stations so this is not so one thing that has changed so we did decide to continue to\npropose that many storage be not allowed within a quarter mile of rail unless you're in an\nindustrial zone district and four drive throughs within a quarter mile of rail to not be\nallowed unless you're in a suburbans one district with some additional restrictions just\nwanted to highlight this bill because this topic by far has gotten the most conversation\nout of anything in the bundle and we've heard a lot of this is great it should go further\nwe should apply it to more areas of the city but we've also heard some this might be a\nlittle bit of an overstep we want to make sure that we're supporting our density and our\nsmall units and giving them pay places to store their stuff and so we really think that\nthe proposal as is in the bundle is a really good first step for treating these we have\nheard a lot that we'd like that there are people who would like to see this potentially\nexpanded to transit corridors or all corridors are all mixed use zoning which is a really\nlarge imp fact on the city transit corridors the reason that we didn't include them as\npart of this is because there's there's a lot less policy surrounding our transit\ncorridors right now there's a lot of planning going on particularly with the denver moves\nplan so as as that infrastructure fills and and as planning and policy kind of is\nsolidified around those areas i think there's definitely room to consider something\nfurther but for now we are remaining with the rail station quarter mile buffer and the\ndowntown zone district changes as i mentioned earlier we are still proposing to increase\nthe rear setback in r m s and m x two x districts when there are adjacent to protect the\ndistrict's annual reminder the reason for this is because the zone districts are intended\nto be embedded in residential areas surrounded by urban houses and duplexes that they\nreally should refer the fact that character that they're intended to be placed in and not\nbe allowed to build to the zero lot line and have a really large hulking structure and so\nas i said there was just a minor change that was proposed in addition to the rear setback\nfor the site interior setback we had proposed to increase that but then we when we looked\nat it again we realized that that was actually inconsistent with the urban how standards\nwhich is what we were basing it off of so we decided to keep that that standard at five\nfeet and then some more of the the little shifts that we've done we are still adding some\nstandards to parking lot lighting we're adding maximum illumination levels for certain\nuses were met adding uniformity ratios for safety and some of the things that we have\nchanged a little bit since we talked with you earlier was some additional clarification on\nwhat projects would be applicable to these changes so basically that projects that are\nsubmitted from here on out will be required to comply with these and not necessarily\nprojects that are already built because that would be really difficult for our inspections\nto enforce and then we had also proposed a mounting height limitation for fixtures on\nthere is already mounting height limitation for free standing lights in the zoning code\nand we were proposing to apply that to all all lights but we realize that that could have\nsome unintended consequences it would prevent someone from having a patio light on their\nthird floor apartment that sort of thing so that's something that we'd like to look at a\nlittle further this is an additional topic that we've had a lot of conversation about\nthrough this bundle process and again this is kind of a first step for some lighting\nchanges to our code code our code doesn't have a lot of lighting standards right now so we\nwant to kind of start with the worst of it and continue to evaluate that through future\nbundle changes and such and then for the two and a half story forms at the low sloped roof\nwe are proposing a ten foot step back above twenty five feet to essentially break up the\nmass of a building from the street so you probably are aware that are two and a half story\nbuilding form can result in something that really appears to be three stories which is\nreally out of context with a lot of what's built in the neighborhoods so this step back\nabove twenty five feet is intended to make the building appear to be more consistent with\ngenerally the two stories that it's it's built around and this is what planning board had\na lot of discussion about based on mister farley's comment asking whether the twenty five\nfeet was the right standard and if there are other things that we hadn't considered as\npart of this so we did study that number more and we did come to the conclusion that\ntwenty five feet is the appropriate height to apply to step back at and we also got the\nfollow up letter from mr varley agreeing but we did actually use the unintended\nconsequences a portion of the planning board recommendation to consider and add the\naddition of an administrative adjustment for historic structures for this step back and so\nin our code we already have allowed administrative adjustments for bulk and height for\nhistoric structures and since this is a bulk related item it was brought to our attention\nby the curtis park neighborhood that this could have some pretty large effects on the\nhistoric character by requiring the step back and so because in historic districts there\nis an additional level of review there's the design standards there's ltd rb or lpc that\nhas to make these decisions we were comfortable adding an administrative adjustment that\nwould allow with the approval of the landmark commission to get out of this step back in\nhistoric districts or historic structures so moving on to the criteria that we use to\naddress text moments on the first is consistency with the city's adopted plans and\npolicies the first is comprehensive plan two thousand which i went over a little earlier\nhow the reason the bundle is consistent with adopt a comp plan including requiring infill\ndevelopment to be consistent we've done a lot in this bundle about consistent infill and\nbulk and mass and then blueprint denver we have language in there that says amendments are\nrecommended to implement adopted plans and improve compatibility with existing plans as\nwell as revised standards to make existing zone districts more compatible which is what a\nlot of these mass inform changes are doing and it furthers the public health safety and\ngeneral welfare by providing clarity and predictability by facilitating planned and\ndesired private enterprise and redevelopment and it continues to implement adopted plans\nthrough regulatory changes and it results in regulations that are uniform on the\namendments regulations are uniform in their application to buildings and land uses within\neach zone districts citywide and it improves greater consistency in zoning regulations and\nremoves conflicting provisions which improves our ability to administer and enforce the\ncode uniformly so with that iowa staff does recommend that the city council approve the\ntext moment twenty eighteen bundle i am happy to answer any questions and talk about any\nof the topics in the bundle especially since we didn't go into the details in the staff\nreport thanks great thank you sir alright we have three speakers this evening i'm gonna\nask them to come to the f front we have joe noble jesse paris and chairman si cu joe\neurope first three minutes good evening council my name is joel noble a little bit to\nseven zero five stout street first i just want to say these these bundles are one of my\nfavorite things this is owning geek because i get exposed to so many of the things that\nended up needing tweaked whether hear about it through neighborhood organizations or comes\nthrough planning board or here about something go through going through the board of\nadjustment for zoning appeals that it's it's always great when it's some time later it\ntakes a little bit of time you see a fixed propose that's been studied and carefully\nconsidered and you say oh that's great i knew that didn't work right i was carrying that\naround with me and now i know it's getting solved john hayden prisoners of curtis park\nneighbors sent a letter to council copying cpd last week thanking cpd for the work on one\npiece here which is a change to the administrative adjustment table and he asked that i\nspeak on on behalf of curtis park neighbors tonight as an advisory board member just\nconveying or thanks curtis park and perhaps other historic neighborhoods from the same era\ntend to be tend to have houses that are narrow and tall and this new upper storey step\nback for low sloped roofs like italian eight structures would require them would actually\nprevent them from being as tall as they normally are or when we have infill in our\nneighborhood that infill should fit in if if a house is built strictly to the zoning code\nit would look quite small compared to the historic context today we depend entirely on\nadministrative adjustment which is a great little escape clause in the zoning code that\nsays the zoning administrator may within certain limits allow some dimensions to be\nexceeded or modified in order to fit the context better if it's beyond that limited\nallowance that needs to go for variance but within within bounds and that works very very\nwell we go through landmark review because they're a landmark district and then whatever\nor administrative adjustments are needed i have never been denied this new measurement was\nnot available for administrative adjustment so that that meant that any infill housing in\ncurtis park that is as tall as our normal housing is or is our context i would have to go\nall the way for a variance which isn't expensive link the and uncertain process and when\nwhen we made that case to cpd they knew exactly what we were talking about they never\nreact quickly they want to always want to go away study came back within a few days and\nsaid okay this narrow allowance on the administrative adjustment table where you're in a\nlandmark district and landmark irc has reviewed it is the minimum necessary to to meet\nyour concerns and in fact it is so thank you to sarah and thank you to kyle dalton and\njennifer beto we're thrilled to see this go forward alright thank you mr noble jesse paris\nyou're up three minutes good evening members of council when i'm jesse pairs my twenty\neight forty two joseph finish street and brooks district nine my question is i'm neither\nfor i'm neither for nor against this i just need clarification on what is a protected\ndistrict is that the same thing as a historical districts what is urban how standards and\nis this in any way going to increase the already gentrification that is going on in the\ncurtis park neighborhood it seems like you guys will just give them leeway to\ngentrification and historically black and brown communities i just need clarification that\nthis build and bundle is not going to do facilitate that further thank you alright thank\nyou chairman sekou six minutes okay here we go my insurance a coup to organize a black\nsocial movements social change agency voice for the poor working poor homeless senior\ncitizens and or youth this bundling to pool all of these seemingly minor pieces that are\nconnected to each other is a good idea on this anytime you can find common ground with\neighty different minor entities and combined them into one big thing is part of\nadministration and of course a lot of thought meetings and explanations that we don't have\nto go through here and just bought it today because the work has been done by planet but\nnow let's look at pulling the layers back of the onion to get to the core about what is\nreally driving and what are the values behind this thing that allows us to miss fours for\ntreats we've got the treason and it's a big thing what's really driving this thing was\nreally trying and that becomes the question for the people because when you do this\nbundling thing when you combine all of these things that you do early and images into one\nvote and then that one vote there are hundreds of millions of dollars gone taxpayers'\nmoney watching this on tv because it means we'll organize at a time with rush hour traffic\njack that can come down here so they get it after the fact and so one of the things we do\nwith this process is to allow it to become educational process for the people who can be\nat the meeting for further review understanding that there's a timeframe that folks got\nthirty sixty days whatever that is to actually implement a change now for vulnerable\ncommunities that's not possible because the people are caught up especially the folks that\ni represent into day to day survival how am i going to pay my rent what am i gonna do\nabout my kids going to school hungry how am i going to do this thing when the food bank is\ngone and i eat transportation crazy i don't have that amount of money to ride the bus so i\ngotta figure out moscow to i can walk to where i got to go let's see caught up in that\nminutia we don't have time to look at the overview about hey man what are they planning\nfor you now that's going to impact your future and then the outreach doesn't include the\nfuture for education processes and to gain them into a better position of being great\ncitizens added in a great city you had no outreach two high school's student comes great\nway to educate him about what we can really do to you so the outreach has to be expanded\ninto student government assistance and university ecologist who are preparing themselves\nto be a part of this not in it because you a it to our nose and due to do but the people\nin the future the you are not included in the outreach so why not invite them to the\nmeeting or had the meeting at a high school where they're at how about a meeting two on a\ncollege campus where they're at see and now we're talking about expanding democracy and\ngetting more folks involved in the participation of the future because it's the students\nand the youth which are the future right now and their voices need to be done right now so\nthey understand what is light industrial has any as you blow past it on the reading they\ndon't know about none of that and change it from this to that they don't even have a bill\neven know what this is right now but we miss a golden opportunity to prepare the future\nleadership to our outrage that can be expanded sea salt the juice has to be included in\nthis thing because they're the ones who are going to be sitting up here because at one\npoint always youth what you learn about this and you're adult how about if you knew this\nnow what kind of adult citizens would that be outstanding so in this process of having\nteam work to make the dream work the dream is about now and it's about the future and is\nabout children is about increasing this empty chamber full of kids who want to come down\nhere and learn how to do this thing on the taxpayers' dollars because they're the\ntaxpayers that are going to be paying for the future things that are happening at least we\ncan do is educate them now in this day so thank you thank you very much this concludes our\nthree speakers for this evening are there any questions by members of council councilman\nortega thank you mr president i do have a question about the two and a half story step\nback and what i'm trying to understand is if that is only applicable to the residential\nzones and is it specific to historic districts or is it help just helped me understand how\nbroadly that is applied share so it is applicable to all of our two and a half storey\nresidential building forms and generally in our mixed use districts we don't have the two\nand a half story building forms because the height limits are higher and so it's going to\nbe your urban house your duplex your two and a half story rowhouse across sport okay so\nwhere the code formerly allowed like half of a third story does this remove that helped me\nunderstand what that so i'll clarify what the half story is because it's not really a half\nstory essentially what it is is it's a third story that's allowed to be no greater than\nseventy five percent of the floor below it and what that was intended to do i may have\nslide here so this slide this image on this slide on the top is from the zoning code and\nit was really what the half story was intended to do when you have the traditional house\nwith the sloped roof and it's two stories you have that space under the sloped roof that's\ntechnically would be considered a third story and we wanted to allow it to be used as\nlivable space so we called that a half story when it's really seventy five percent of the\nfloor below it's a third story and you can see that this is a photo example of infill that\nhas used that and you can see it's generally pretty in scale with surrounding but\nessentially what's been happening is people take that allowance and when you use a flat\nroofed form or as we're redefining in the bundle low slope and you push it to the front of\nthe building it really looks like a full three stories and you can see it towering over\nthe the surrounding infill development and to what this is intended to do do is to push\nback that third story we haven't made any changes to the allowance of how much of it but\nit's possible that there will be less allow for allowed flour area if they can't get that\nfull seventy five percent after having to to step it back ten feet from the front of the\nbuilding okay that's very helpful thank you i have no further questions thank you\ncouncilwoman against one espinoza do you want to take a stab at explaining what a\nprotected district is chirp and so a protected district is essentially in practice a low\nscale residential district we have a definition in the code it's got a list of oliver's\none districts that are considered protected districts it's all of our single unit\ndistricts oliver two unit districts i think all of our own house districts and one multi\nunit district the m u two and a half and what that means is when you have a mixed use zone\ndistrict adjacent to something that's considered a protected district things that are\nbuilt on that lot have to comply with additional standards usually it's additional\nsetbacks or additional bulk playing that sort of thing to protect the character of the low\nscale residential that it's adjacent to but the disc we're only talking about the mapped\ndistrict the the the the physical map district it doesn't it's it doesn't matter whether\nor not the building is a low scale residential building that's correct alright hope that\nhelps thanks thank you no further questions okay thank you seeing no other questions this\nconcludes the public hearing of three twenty three comments by maria's account so doctor\nsays thank you mr president i just want to thank the cpd and the planning board for the\nwork that you did on this bundle and while it is a lot of things that really dives into\nthings that we have had some concerns about that we hear about it committee they will hear\nabout some neighbors who are worried about construction going on next door thanks for the\nexplanation of the two point five because i too was thinking he's really seventy five\npercent of the top but if they can't get the ten foot setback it may not be so ninety five\npercent of the top of it right ok and also for in you know increasing the setbacks but but\nspecially for the storage units many stores and i think i have to thank my fellow\ncouncilwoman kendra black who also brought this forwards that this is a very good move i\nthink to help us with getting activation around areas of transit and mainstreet thank you\nalright thank you dr sussman counsel in black want to thank sarah you are really great and\nwith the t o d limiting the storage and the drive throughs i wanted to go a little further\nbut i acknowledge it's a good first step and i appreciate you reaching out to the storage\nunit as well association we met with them and they were okay with it and the drive through\npeople never got back to us so i really appreciate it my district has five light rail\nstations and a lot of storage facilities and we don't want to have anywhere near our light\nrail station so thank you very much alright thank you councilman black espinosa becomes\none of smoke is there a drive through association i also wanted to thank you again sarah\nand staff or another text amendment it's always nice to see these changes i don't think i\ngeek out as much as joel does but it is fun to see incremental change to our zoning code\nand the one thing that i you made it very clear that you're you're you're cognizant there\nmight be unintended consequences and you're sort of recognizing that there's still the\nability for things you haven't considered come about and i think in in an earlier\npresentation that sort of opined where i saw the sort of something breaking down and the\nso i'm going to go back to something i said i think two or three meter months ago which is\nis if staff is is seen that speak up and let the zoning administrator know that there is\nthis repeated incidents happening that may not warrant a you may rise to an occasion where\nyou're not following the usual text amendment but then bringing it to grab you can even\nhaving him move forward with a quick change it it'll still be a public process we will\nstill have the ability to discuss it but let's not wait for repeated sort of habitual\npattern to form and and get so deliberative in if we are already recognizing that one\nchange we've made has unintended consequences that could be addressed maybe by coupling\nwarm standard with a use exception or something like that you know so that's all just\nwanted to make sure that i'm probably going to keep hitting that point time and time again\nnow because it's sort of my one thing is how do we more rapidly address things that go\nsouth when when we know better so that's it thanks alright thank you thank you all thank\nyou cpd for for putting this forward and you know i think you guys are are starting to\nadjust and i'm in issues that we're seeing all over the city and really appreciate that\neveryone does low speed and we want this to be faster but at the same time i i don't want\nto say but we want it faster we want more speed let's just leave a period there i will\nalso say that i recognize the macro changes that were happening about this the city and\nthese until ten o'clock consequences have happened in my district they've happened in\nother districts and and i understand those are sometimes irreversible and so i appreciate\nit but as long as we can figure out how to churn a little faster on some of these things\nit will be very helpful to folks you see up here or on the front front lines of dealing\nwith a lot of our yet land use issues and we're getting we have a lot of idea does and so\ndo we want to see those things move but thank you for your heart work and

## Use Case

Legal audio recordings are often lengthy and difficult to review manually. This system helps by:
- Transcribing legal audio into readable text
- Dividing the transcript into topic-based sections
- Extracting key legal terms and phrases
- Allowing users to search and review specific arguments quickly

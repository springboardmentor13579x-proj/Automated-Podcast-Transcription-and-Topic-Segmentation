Seeing none the minutes stand approved. Announcements Council announcements. And I will go ahead and go first because we've got some. Board of equalization information tonight council was scheduled to sit as the quasi judicial board of equalization to consider reduction of total cost assessments for local maintenance districts. However, since no written protests of assessment were filed with the manager of the department of transportation and infrastructure by October 22nd council will not sit as the board of equalization for the following local maintenance districts was 38th Avenue phase one. pedestrian mall expanded Greek town pedestrian mall golden triangle pedestrian mall phase two west 38th Avenue pedestrian mall 32nd and low pedestrian mall Broadway pedestrian mall be phase two Broadway pedestrian mall Broadway viaduct pedestrian mall 22nd street and park Avenue west pedestrian mall consolidated Morrison road pedestrian mall and skyline park. And with that announcement being done, we will go ahead and go to council members council member can each. Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank the people of Denver for their vote in favor of many of the items referred by this council, but in particular I wanted to just provide a few updates on to be to reduce homelessness. I know that this is a topic that we heard a lot of public comment about tonight and I, you know, these, these informational updates are not necessarily in direct response to those testimonies, but they do overlap in terms of the interest people have. So as a reminder, the ordinance requires a one year implementation plan be finalized by January 31. And so here's how this will work. Right now, just today, the period closed for the comments on the 21 2021 action plan for the existing housing funds that the city had not counting to be so they're in the process of taking all that feedback they'll revise that plan. And then what they're going to do is release a draft addendum to the plan, and that will be on the city's website. So if you go to Denver Gov slash Denver Gov dot org slash housing. And then you go to about, you'll see when it's available, it will be posted there, all of your council members will all get that information and I'm sure we'll share it with our constituents. And the community will have the opportunity to give input on the use of those dollars. Reminder the voter approval was for 40 million, but in fact, we know that 2021 is likely to be a more modest year so we will probably be programming something in the mid 30 range 30 million dollar range. And just as a quick reminder, we do have more than 2000 people a night choosing shelter in Denver. So we do have those living on the streets but we have more than 2000 people living in shelter.

Right now, we are using federal dollars to provide that social distancing and it is working the rate of COVID infection among those experiencing homelessness is actually lower, lower than it is among the general population. If those federal dollars are no longer available, the two be dollars will step in. So for those who've been asking questions about why, why spending money on shelter because we do have people who are, who are choosing to stay safe from the elements and whose lives are being saved in a variety of settings, including 24 hours shelter. So if those dollars are not needed for that purpose because federal dollars will continue, then more can be spent on the other options. So there is an estimate that the dollars will provide 500 people with housing. We can have a big debate about methodology, but the short story is that rental assistance that goes with a person along with services is working to house people to deliver. And the estimate is that in 2021, at least 500 people, again, and that could grow if we don't need those dollars for some of the things that the federal funds are paying for today. And then we have funding that could be available for other types of interventions, you know, outreach to those on the streets. So your priorities for housing Denver is using a housing first model. These dollars will be primarily focused on permanent housing in years two through 10 building new housing faster than we would have otherwise and making it more units than we would have otherwise. But we know construction takes time, which is why in 2021 the proposal is to immediately use those dollars for some rental assistance to get people housed in existing units. So the plan has space for all of these strategies in it. And your input will be used. And then just a reminder, the way our budget works, the budget we're going to be debating tonight does not include the two B dollars because that election hasn't even been certified yet. But what will happen is in early 2021, this council will see a budget, what we call a supplemental to program those dollars. So first we'll come the plan. Then we'll come the supplemental community input will be taken. And so folks can either, you know, stay in touch with my office or stay in touch with the city's housing website. And I think that what we will see is dramatic investments being made in 2021 to help those who are unhoused. In addition to the existing funding we've set aside for safe outdoor spaces and other strategies so together, just to give you a sense of scale, our housing fund and the two B dollars that were approved by 2030 should be approaching the range of three quarters of a billion dollars, three quarters of a billion dollars by 2030, depending a little bit on the economy, depending a little bit on how development goes and linkage fees. But that is a significant investment. The people of Denver are making to address these issues. And I just think that it bears underlining that property tax, marijuana tax, and now a sales tax all working together with developer fees to fund a very very sizable investment. And so just a minute to celebrate before we get into more debate over other other new topics. But in this case, we're going to be making some huge strides. So thank you to my colleagues and to the people of Denver. Thank you, Councilwoman Keniche and congratulations as well to you, but the rest of our colleagues as well who ran eight other ballot initiatives and were successful as well last Tuesday. Councilwoman Black, you're up. Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to remind people who live in Southeast Denver that tomorrow night from 530 till seven we're having your virtual community meeting discussing creating mobility hubs at the Yale light rail station and the Southmore light rail station. So please join us if you're interested. You can get more information from my website or check in with me via email or phone and I'll give you the information to attend the meeting. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Himes. Thank you, Madam President. I also want to extend some of the comments that Councilmember Keniche made just a few minutes ago. I won't go back over all the full range of comments that she made, but, but I do want to make everyone aware that there are two proposed safe outdoor spaces. Currently on the table, both in district 10. The first is at the parking lot of the first Baptist Church 14th and grant. And the second is at Denver Community Church

at 16th and Pearl. I know there has been strong resistance of the proposed safe outdoor spaces in district nine, both of the Colosseum and a Blair Caldwell library. So there's strong resistance in district 10 for these two proposed sites as well. I believe that the long term, the best long term solution for people experiencing homelessness is housing with wraparound services safe outdoor spaces aren't a long term solution and they're not meant to be still until we create better housing opportunities and more affordable housing, including advocating to our state counterparts for a repeal of the legislation known as the Telluride decision. It is it being safe open spaces is the best of our less than ideal options. Safe outdoor spaces are very different than the 10 cities we've experienced lately around district 10 and so many other locations in Denver. They are a critical tool in our toolbox that we must learn to use effectively, even if they aren't our first choice. The spaces provide clean transitional housing and wraparound services and limited location that is staffed 24 seven for social services, safety and hygiene. All of you to learn more about what these sites are and how they are so different from what we have experienced over these last several months and and frankly years in district 10. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Hines Councilwoman, say to Baca. Thank you, Madam President, just wanted to remind people last week we mentioned that if you needed a turkey or a holiday dinner to sign up at Epworth Church for that. We now have a new donor in GES that is specifically giving away a hundred turkeys to residents of Gloville, Alleria or Swansea. And so if you are interested, if you need a turkey, please go on our Facebook and sign up on the Google form there or email our office or call our office, our emails district nine at Denver gov.org and we will get you on that list. Thanks. Thank you, Councilman, Councilman Herndon. Thank you, Madam President. I'm long spirit with Councilman Kenich. I wanted to thank the voters for their support of two Jay. And for those of you who have questions and I've, I've received questions from individuals already won the at the election has not been certified. It will take effect January one, but we already have on the Denver animal protection website, the steps that owners of pit bulls would need to take in order to get the pit bull permit. So you could just Google Denver animal protection or go to the city, a Denver Gov website, go to Denver animal protection. You can get all the information that you need for that. And I also just want to take a moment because we have certainly recognized several individuals for a part of that, but a name that has not been spoken of that you cannot state about this is Carla Madison. And for some of my newer colleagues who may not know her, she was a, she was a processor in district eight and her personality was just as bright as her hair. And when I was campaigning in 2010 when she met with me, we talked about pit bulls and her efforts when she got on city council about that and wondering how I felt about the topic. So, I mean, unfortunately, she passed the cancer, but I just wanted to say this could not have been possible without Carla as well. And Carla, this one is certainly you are a huge piece of this rest in peace. And thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Herndon, Councilman Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. I would just like to make an announcement that an initiative I've been working my office has been working on for the community members in Northwest Denver and Denver as a whole. The changing of Columbus Park to Larasa Park is going in front of the Parks and Rec Advisory Board next Monday at 5 30. If you would like to sign up to speak, you can visit my Facebook page or to get the information or you can email arthur.gilkinsonatdembergov.org. And also, if you'd like more information, you can email my office district, ONE at Denvergov.org, and you will respond with how to sign up to speak in favor of this initiative and also how to write a letter of support. Once again, that's next Monday, November 16 at 5 30 virtually. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Sandoval. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Along the lines of my colleagues have talked about some of the initiatives or charter changes that passed. I wanted to just let you all know that I've already been working with the city

attorney's office on the professional services ordinance that will follow. And we're looking at scheduling some time with our policy committee and then looking at bringing it to the appropriate Committee of Council to move a draft ordinance forward. I want to get your thoughts and input. I've put some thoughts on paper have been having some back and forth conversations with the city attorney's office and we'll have a draft before you when we get scheduled to come to the policy committee. Secondly, I just wanted to mention that the Department of Transportation Advisory Board also passed and reached out to. You know, it's correctly's office to find out, you know, what categories they're looking at appointing so that as we all begin to think about who the people are we might want to recommend because each one of us has an appointment as well. We'd like to do that in collaboration to ensure that we're representing diversity of the different types of transportation but also ethnic and economic diversity across our city. So we have some of that information to share and push out to you. We want to do that so that you can be thoughtful about who you might want to appoint so that we're trying to cover that. So those issues across the board. So, thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Madam President. I'd also like to thank the voters of Denver for their support of two H, which removed restrictions of a state law Senate bill 152, which placed barriers on the discussion of how we bridge the digital divide that has about 20% of our city, most of all in our traditionally underserved neighborhoods from having regular access to broadband services, as was said during the campaign. Two H came with no particular solution, no price tag, but it does clear the runway for a full discussion of how we make sure that our students and our underserved communities, businesses, folks needing telehealth services have access to the broadband connections they need. I look forward to that discussion unfolding in the coming months. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Cashman, Councilwoman Sawyer. Thanks so much, Madam President. I also just want to thank the voters for supporting supporting both of my initiatives. This is the first one that Councilwoman C to Baca and I put together together to E, which is Council approval of mayoral appointees, very much appreciate that. And to F as well, which is just modernization of some charter language and already working on some updates to the charter and our ordinances to do some remote meetings policies and things like that. If anyone who's got questions, feel free to reach out to Denver Council by that Denver Gov.org. Happy to chat about that and stay tuned for more information. Thanks so much. Thank you, Councilwoman, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Madam President. Along with folks thanking the voters, I wanted to inject a note of thanks and congratulations to Clerk and Recorder's Office and Clerk Lopez for an election that seems to have run flawlessly. And I think is a model for the nation, not just Denver, but the state of Colorado with our mail in balloting that works. And it's distressing to see what's going on around the country while questioning this when we've been doing this for about six, seven years now. And it's been done very successfully. And I think that Clerk Lopez and his entire crew should be congratulated for that. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Herndon. We have you back up. Yes, Madam President, I apologize. One more thing I wanted to note for the land use transportation and infrastructure committee tomorrow. We are continuing the conversation on individual, individual portions of the group living. I had announced that land use who would be starting at 10 a.m. Unfortunately, we didn't properly notify it. So the notification that came out at the end of the week said 10 30 and we did not catch that in time for the 48 hour to amend it. So we will be starting at 10 30 tomorrow and we will spend the entire committee speaking to the group living portion when it comes to community correction. So I wanted to make sure I announced 10 a.m. It'll actually be at 10 30. We will dedicate the entire time to my colleagues. You should have received an email from CPD with some of the slides. We will I will encourage them to move through it a little bit more quickly since we have less time. So there's as much time as possible for Council members to ask their questions and to share their thoughts from this particular portion of group living. Thank you

Madam President. Thank you. Councilman Herndon and seeing no other hands raised. I have got a couple announcements. Just want to remind folks that over the weekend are home by 10 p.m. Initiative went in our COVID rates continue to rise in the city. And so we're asking folks to severely limit your activities. Hopefully you'll be able to stay at home from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. each day and reminding you to continue wearing your masks and taking all of the health and safety precautions to lower the COVID rates and then also want to send congratulations to our president elect Biden and vice president elect Harris. This is a historic time for our democracy. And we had patience. We allowed our votes to be counted. And as Americans, we trust in our democratic process and the integrity of our electoral system. And we saw a record turnout across the nation and in Denver. And on a personal note, as a woman and a mom with two daughters, I'm elated to finally see a woman and a woman of color in the White House. And so just want to want to leave that there and representation definitely matters. And we look forward to their leadership and vision to heal and bring our country together. And after these four years of dysfunction with our White House, we know that this election brings new hope, compassion and collaboration. And so appreciate all of the voters in Denver and your commitment to our democratic process. Seeing no other announcements. There are no presentations. There are no communications. There are no proclamations. Council will now vote to either adopt or reject the mayor's proposed 2021 budget council member black. We need a motion to adopt please. Oh, you're muted. I haven't learned that yet. I move that the mayor's 2020, the mayor's proposed 2021 budget be adopted. Second, it has been moved and seconded comments from members of council. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. First, I just wanted to thank my colleagues for putting together some thoughtful recommendations that look like they were going to have to be done via amendments to the budget, but to the mayor's credit. He found a way to fund the vast majority of those items that council had identified. And I think that speaks a lot to the importance of trying to collaborate and make sure that those issues that had been identified as priorities by the mayor. I think that's a great thing. Many people from our community through the input that we get on Monday nights and through emails are moving the needle way far down the road well beyond what we've been doing with the COVID dollars that have been in play trying to ensure that we're addressing many of the needs of our vulnerable communities. So I just wanted to say congratulations to everybody on some great work that took place during this process. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman can each. Thank you, Madam President. There is no question that the budget process is always a bear and it was a really tougher bear this year. I appreciate Councilwoman Artega's comments about the things that were added based on the council input after the draft budget was released. Personally, I am excited that our permanent restrooms will be open that our citizen oversight board will have a full time staffer to help them with their police accountability work. And also that we have a path to be able to expand the star program in 2021 to reach more than the point to 6% of eligible calls that they're taking now we have a lot of room to reach a larger number of calls and I really appreciate working with Councilwoman Seidabaka on some of those conversations. But I also just want to remind I guess ourselves and the community that the things that were achieved in those final negotiations are not the only impact this Council had on this budget. There were many items that we advocated for in the year and months leading up to the draft budget that were included. And I just want to highlight a couple of those, which is participatory budgeting has been a priority. It was in this year's budget and delayed implementation, and it might have been an attractive thing to cut for next year. And it wasn't cut the administration worked with us to keep that in this budget. We didn't have to fight for it. And what it will mean is that several neighborhoods that have had neighborhood plans. Identifying ways that they want to be able to retain sustainability for their community and retain residents will have some dollars to vote on democratically for projects that can help implement those

plans. And then there will be a city wide process for folks to vote on projects to advance mobility and safety. So those really important dollars were in this draft budget from day one. Other important priorities like funding for staffing to do resident prioritization. We have a policy we've been working on for quite some time. It wasn't quite ready yet to come to Council or to be implemented. The funding is there for the staff and the computer system to make sure that as we build new affordable housing, we can prioritize residents at risk of displacement to stay in their communities. Those are examples of things that were in this draft budget in addition to frankly, just some really important tough work to keep basic services going during this time. And so I do want to thank the agencies that worked on those items, both before the first draft, as well as those agencies that worked with us in these final changes and the budget office. It is not an easy year. But this budget did protect funding for housing and homelessness in a way that it was not able to protect all city services. And, and we talked already about some expansions that are coming so just want to thank my colleagues for that work that you all did before that first draft budget, as well as since then. And, and I feel very proud of our ability to continue to govern during such a difficult financial time. So I will be supporting this budget tonight. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman can each and seeing no other hands raised. I'll go ahead and offer my comments. You know, as Denver City Council, we began to prepare for the 2021 budget process in July of this year through setting up the budget and policy committee. Through our the committee, but then also with our budget and policy retreat that we held in July of 2021, we came together and determined six overarching budget priorities that we committed to pursue together through a racial equity lens. And in a year that we were met with a global pandemic, a civil rights movement and economic uncertainty that this city's general fund has never seen or had to face shortfalls like we have Denver City Council carried forward the voices and the values of equity from our constituents in our budget and in our 2021 budget request. Through our budget hearing process, we heard from 21 city agencies, we had three dedicated Council budget working sessions, and we listened to our constituents through public listening sessions, weekly public comment and our public hearing that we held last week on the budget. And this Council working together, we were able to secure close to $5.2 million to fund important budget priorities. That's a million more than we were able to secure last year in some of the best economic times. And this really is a credit to this city Council and how we have pulled together and worked on this. And I'm so proud. And I know that we have much more to accomplish together, but I want to take that time and celebrate this success as well. And would also like to acknowledge Mayor Hancock and his administration for coming together and compromising with Council and essentially funding all of our budget requests and then also humbly thanking our amazing and resilient city employees who continue to serve every single day to help our residents and neighborhoods make sure that they can navigate these times. And so we thank you for that work as well to our city employees. Madam Secretary, roll call on the motion to adopt the mayor's proposed 2021 budget, please. I see the baca. Nope. Clark. Hi. Flynn.

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Council members, this is your last opportunity to call out an item. Council member Black, will you please make the motions for us this evening? Yes, I will Madam President. Thank you. Now, I'll do a recap recap under resolutions. Council members say to Baca has called out resolutions 1174 and 1144 for questions under bills for introduction. No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. No items have been called out. Under pending, no items have been called out. The first item up is Council resolution 1174 Council members say to Baca, please go ahead with your questions. Thank you, Madam President. Is there anybody here who can speak to the summer scholars program? My name is Janine Ford. I'm here to answer questions. Hi, Janine, I am just curious about the modification during COVID. This contract is for after school recreation programs and swim lessons. And with recreation centers closed and likely not a lot of swimming happening. I'm curious about the modification. Sure. So their, their fiscal year that they do their, their invoicing for us. We do it from the school year of September 1st, 2019 through August 31st, 2020. And so the billing was from the after school program during the school year up until the point of, you know, the COVID. Well, when COVID hit, basically, and then they had some modified programming within it. The swim lessons were not. They're not running through the number of parks and recreation. They actually provide like higher staff and do swim lessons at high schools. Although it did not run this summer due to COVID. So basically the, the money that we're asking for because the was 117,416 is basically the modified amount because it should have been 125 that we would have been paying out. I'm, what is the 117 paying for 120? The 117 is paying for the after school program from August, 2019 through March of 2020 plus the modified virtual programming that they did for the remainder of the school year and some of that during the summer. Is it possible for you to follow up with some details about how that breaks down? We know some folks who were in summer scholars and program was discontinued, but they don't recall getting services prior to March. So just want to double check that if you can send over information that would be helpful. I will reach out to them and get that information for you. Thank you very much. And then do you know really quickly, do you know which, I guess, district or that type of thing that they were, they were in. Because there's their locations change based on, you know, their funding year and what's, you know, if something gets dropped because their, their grants fund expired, things like that. And so their locations have a tendency to revolve based on, you know, their, their grant funding. Council member, you're out there. Are there particular ones that did not that stopped that you're thinking of? I think there was a. Trying to remember, I think that was it would year that was termed. And I think Harrington and Columbine, which have been long standings that are, were ending their funding. But that I have, I'd have to double check with them. Yeah, those are all in my district. And so that might be why we're hearing it. So break down of what the money got spent on. That would be helpful. And you're, and you're confirming that this is a retroactive payment. Yes. These are services rendered. So basically, this is a bill that we owe them at this point in time. Once it's paid, the contract is expired and ended. And do, do we typically approve as city council? Do we typically approve after the grant is spent or before? It's typically before problem was, is we had an issue back in 2015 when this grant or this contract was originally. Brought on or renewed. The invoice for the 2014. Actually got paid out of

the new contract. And that's why we have a shortage right now. And so that's why we're asking city council to approve the 117 or 16 at this point in time to pay for services rendered. Due to the, the error back in 2015. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Janine and thank you, councilwoman. The next item up is council resolution 1144 council member. Say to Baca, please go ahead with your questions on this one. Thank you, Madam president. I just wanted to get clarification. I was looking through the present. That was uploaded in Granicus and the presentation slide five. Said that the contract was for 4.5 million. It says that this is a $4 million contract. But then it also says that the $4.5 million would only serve 200 individuals. And that breaks down to over $22,000 per individual that we're serving. And so I just wanted to get some clarity. On the numbers and understand if those numbers were correct. Great. We have James Ginsburg here to help answer those questions. Thank you, councilwoman for that question. That's correct. It did get adjusted down to 4 million. So that translates per person a slightly lower. But it does serve that number of people. We will still serve at least 200 households. And it does translate, yeah, to 20,000 per household. And so when you when we devote $20,000 to an individual. Are we able to see as council the breakdown of how those dollars are spent? Like what are we, what does that $20,000 pay for for each individual? Right. So it includes a real comprehensive package, including rental assistance, which will be time limited. So that's up to 24 months. Damage deposits, security deposits first and last month's rent. And then comprehensive services with the collaborative partnership. So case management, housing, housing, housing, housing, housing, housing, housing, housing, housing. And with those, do we have success rates or how do we actually measure success? Yes. So we will be, we do have targets in terms of retention of housing and retention of permanent housing. And so the ultimate outcome, of course, is retention of permanent housing. And then because it's time limited, the supportive services eventually will and their rental assistance will drop off. So then the, the measure is households ability to self sustained without the assistance. Awesome. If it's possible, can you send me more data after that? I'll send you more data after this about how that breaks down per individual with numbers connected to it. $20,000 per individual to get someone back into housing seems pretty reasonable to me and fits along with what we talked about last week with master leasing properties. I'm curious about the exact numbers for each of those sections and would love to see that data. But that's it for my questions. Thank you. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, James. Thank you, Councilwoman. That concludes the items to be called out. Any bills for introduction are ordered published council members.

This week on Your City Now, voting results are in, a positive step for homeless campsites, and the mayor urges you to be home by 10. These stories are just ahead on Your City Now. The mayor announced that Colorado now has the sixth highest rate of increase in COVID cases and hospitalizations. With how it's going now, there's another stay-at-home order in our future unless we act with urgency and care for one another to change the behavior that is leading to these increasing cases. One step we're announcing today is what we're calling a home by 10 order. Now, we'll restrict nighttime business hours, particularly for bars, clubs, and restaurants, and urge residents to be in their own homes and not gathering or mixing in other households. We need everyone working together to reverse the trend. In case you're just waking up from a nap under a rock, there was an election on Tuesday and nearly all of the results are in. Here are highlights of results from Denver's six-page ballot. All incumbent candidates on the ballot for state legislature offices located in Denver won their races. This included Susan Lontine in House District 1, Alec Garnett in House District 2, Serena Gonzales Gutierrez in House District 4, Alex Valdez in House District 5, Steve Woodrow in House District 6, and Emily Sarota in House District 9. In state Senate District 31, incumbent Chris Hansen keeps his seat, and in District 33, James Coleman was the winner. Beth McCann retains her seat as Denver DA in State Judicial District 2. Denver voters were asked to weigh in on 13 ballot measures, and notable results showed them approving city council oversight of 14 mayoral appointments, hiring of their own professional services, including legal counsel, and giving council the power to initiate appropriations of new and excess revenues in the city budget. Voters also approved increased sales taxes to fund climate action and homelessness assistance, and for the first time in 30 years, pit bulls will be allowed in Denver with a permit. The latest results for all the candidate races and the state ballot issues are available at denvervotes.org. Recently, Denver took an important step towards temporary managed campsites for those experiencing homelessness during the pandemic as it began requesting proposals from vendors to manage these sites. The goal of a temporary managed campsite is really to reduce harm. This isn't the long-term solution, but rather something that we brought into our awareness and openness as a city as part of our public health response. This RFP shows one more way in which the city of Denver is willing to take extraordinary measures in these extraordinary times. These types of sites have never been realized here in Denver, and a series of obstacles have had to be overcome to get to this point. City Council cleared two of those roadblocks by approving temporary

changes to the zoning code as well as a transfer of $450,000 to the COVID-19 emergency fund to provide funding for these sites. The mayor has expressed support for potentially three sites of 60 people apiece, but the city will evaluate any and all proposals brought forward through the process. We will do everything we can to realize a healthy house and connect to Denver. So if you're someone who has an idea for how to manage a temporary managed campsite, please put it forward and have it for consideration of the Department of Health and Stability. Host will accept proposals through November 13th and will select vendors in December at the earliest. When residents are out enjoying a Denver park and see a maintenance issue of any kind, they can call 311 to report it. Or if they use pocket gov they can even attach a helpful photo when submitting their case. Issues can be anything from graffiti to bathroom maintenance, trash and debris to overgrown or dead grass, even broken lights or sprinklers. From this submission 311 will create a work order that parks and recreation will then respond to. If you are reporting a maintenance issue in a Denver mountain park, 311 can also put you in touch with the correct agency to handle that. Using 311 and pocket go, residents can help the city to help everyone have an enjoyable experience in our Denver open spaces. You can catch new episodes of your city now every Friday. Thanks for watching Denver. This week we're sitting now voting resulted in a positive step for home. Denver like cities across this nation is facing the triple threats of a public health pandemic. An economic collapse and a long overdue reckoning on race. But Denver is not like other cities. You see in Denver we have a history and tradition of coming together to tackle big problems. We take care of our most vulnerable. Engage our community and invest in equity so that even during the toughest times we not only survive we thrive together. We're a city on the rise. This is Denver. We have two public hearings tonight. Speakers should begin their remarks by telling the council their names and cities of residents and if they feel comfortable doing so their home addresses. When called upon please wait until our meeting hosts promote you to speaker. When you are promoted your screen will flash and say reconnecting to meeting. Please do not leave the meeting. You will be reconnected and will need to turn on your camera if you have one and your microphone. If you have signed up to answer questions only state your name and note that you're available for questions of council. Speakers will have three minutes. There is no yielding of time. You will see your time flash on the screen when you have 30 seconds left. Speakers must stay on the topic of the hearing and must direct their comments to the council members. Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks. Council member black will you please put council bill 966 on the floor for passage. Yes, madam president. I move that council bill 20-0966 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded by councilman Herndon. The required public hearing for council bill 20-0966 is open. May we please have the staff report. Thank you madam president. This is James Van Hooser with CPD. Are you able to hear me and also see the powerpoint presentation? Yes, James. Thank you. Before you today we have a requested rezoning at 4407-4501-4505-4595 and 4601 West Alameda Avenue. The request is to go from PUD 550 and E-S-U-D-X to the EMX-3 zone district. The property in question is located in council district 3 in the Barnum West neighborhood. The proposals are approximately 5.1 acres and the EMX-3 zone district allows for the townhouse shop front and general building forms with a max building height of three stories and 38 feet. The existing PUD 550 houses a five-story senior living facility as well as chapel and office and community center use. The E-S-U-D-X zone parcel houses a single unit residence. The property to be rezoned is surrounded by other E-S-U-D-X properties as well as some old code PUD and R2. There is a section of EMX-3 to the west as well as E-T-U-C. Those are two unit zone districts to the south. Existing land use on the parcel is multi-unit residential as well as public quasi-public uses and parking as well as the single unit residential for the one parcel. It is surrounded by other single unit residential and public quasi-public uses with some

commercial and retail to the west. It's also and parking open space along the Gulch to the north and west. Here are some photos of the existing structures on property and here are some context photos around the photo in the bottom left is the parcel in question as is the photo in the center right and the other photos are for context in the neighborhood. This is information we noticed on June 4th 2020. It went before planning board on September 16th and planning board unanimously recommended council approval. Ludi committee voted unanimously to move the application to the full city council. At this time there have been three neighbor letters and one R&O letter of support that were in the council packet. We have had no letters of opposition on this proposed rezoning. For council to approve this rezoning you'll need to find it consistent with the five criteria consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, that it furthers public health safety and welfare, that it meets the justifying circumstances and has consistency with the neighborhood context, some district purpose and intent. We'll begin with consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans relevant to these parcels, comp plan 2040, blueprint which was adopted in 2019 and the Barnum West neighborhood plan which was adopted in 1986. The proposed rezoning is consistent with a number of comp plan 2040 strategies and goals including equitable, affordable and inclusive goals, economically diverse and vibrant goals and environmentally resilient goals. Moving on to blueprint Denver, looking at our future neighborhood context map. The parcels are classified in the urban edge context. The urban edge neighborhood context contains elements of the server urban and urban context, small multi-unit residential and commercial areas are typically embedded in one and two unit residential areas and the intent of the EMX three zone district specifically is to promote safe active and pedestrian scale diverse areas and enhance the convenience and ease of walking shopping and public gathering within and around the city's neighborhoods. Moving on to blueprint Denver's future place type, these parcels are located in a community corridor within the urban edge context. Community corridors should have a balance of either residential and employment, residential and dining or shopping who are employment and dining shopping uses in a community corridor in the urban edge neighborhood context. I recommended heights are generally up to five stories. Again, that's just the basic blueprint guidance you would also need to pay attention to any small planned guidance that might have additional guidance on height. Looking at the blueprint Denver future growth strategies, again, these parcels are considered community centers and corridors which are anticipated to see around 25 percent of new housing growth and 20 percent of new employment growth by 2040. Most growth in the city is guided to regional centers, community centers and corridors and select districts of high and medium, high intensity residential areas and this community centers and corridors certainly falls within that anticipated growth pattern. So blueprint Denver contains three equity concepts to help guide change to benefit everyone and each equity concept has associated measurements that help inform implementation actions through large rezoning and along with other implementation actions. CPD undergoes the equity analysis when a parcel is proposed to be rezoned at five acres or larger 5.1 acres this site did undergo an equity analysis. Our first equity concept is access to opportunity. So the basis for measuring access opportunity is composite of the neighborhood equity index developed by the Department of Public Health and Environment, proximity to high capacity and frequent transit and access to centers and corridors. Access to opportunity helps us to consider if we are making progress towards achieving the vision for complete neighborhoods across the city. So this subject property is an area with moderate access to opportunity, scores well on access to community corridors and centers and scores average on the equity index measurements. Those are social determinants of health, access to healthcare, child morbidity and built environment subjects while scoring poorly on access to transit. I did want to caveat that the access to transit metric is specific to rail transit. While the subject scores poorly on access to transit due to little proximity to lag rail stations, the RTD number three bus line has a stop directly in front of the property on Alameda Avenue. The second equity concept is vulnerability to involuntary displacement. Basis for measuring this metric is the vulnerability to use placement index developed by the Denver Economic Development and Opportunity Office. This combines data from medium household income percentage of people who rent and percentage of population with less than a college degree. This application scores, pardon me, the parcels associated with this application score a moderate

to high vulnerability to involuntary displacement, scoring vulnerable in two of the three metrics that's median household income ratio and bachelor's degree attainment ratio and not vulnerable in the third metric of rental occupancy ratio. The application identifies that the Salvation Army's housing components are paired with programs that provide career guidance and workforce training initiatives that allow those living on the property the opportunity to incrementally move their way up creating new and better opportunities. Staff finds that this rezoning application has the potential to have a positive impact on the vulnerability to displacement metric if the Salvation Army is able to to continue with the services that they have outlined in their application. So the third concept in equity is expanding housing and jobs diversity. We're looking at the housing map here. Housing diversity map combines census tract level data measuring the percentage of middle density housing and that's housing with two to 19 units. Home size diversity, ownership versus rental, housing costs, and the number of income restricted units. So this parcel is in an area that scores not diverse in four of the five metrics. There is diversity in home size, but housing diversity, tenure diversity, housing costs, and number of affordable units are all not as diverse as desired. The application, the applicant states in the application that the proposed developments on the site would create a greater mix and range of housing types in the Barnum West neighborhood offering diversity in housing types with amenities attached and supported by programs through the Salvation Army. Staff concurs with this based just on the base zoning of EMX3. Multi-unit residential is an allowed use in the proposed zone district and that can have a positive impact on the housing diversity by allowing an increase in the number of multi-unit residences in the area. And finally to jobs diversity. So this map shows the mix of jobs depicted by color within the city. Block groups with less than 100 total jobs including the block that this parcel falls into have less than 100 jobs. So we're left out of the analysis. So there are not a whole lot of jobs located in this area. The proposed zone district, EMX3 allows for various commercial office and retail jobs and increasing access to a range of many quality jobs enables people of different incomes and education levels to find employment and wealth building opportunities. As there are a few jobs in this area, staff finds that this application could have a positive impact on the area's job diversity by allowing a zone district that allows for more and different commercial and office retail uses. Moving on to consistency with the neighborhood plan. So the Barnum Barnum West neighborhood plan was adopted in 1986. Some of the key concepts within the plan were a desire to maintain residential zoning along West Elameda, develop setbacks and landscape policies for new developments within the neighborhood business zones, focus on developer owner occupied infill and looking for traffic solutions. I wanted to call attention to one specific recommendation in this plan that is now 34 years old. It shall be the recommendation to maintain the residential zoning along West Elameda Avenue and to selectively review any proposed developments which might be advantageous to neighborhood interests through the planned unit development approach. In the years since this plan guidance was initially developed, the city has moved away from a preference towards customized zoning and planned unit developments. The adoption of the 2010 Denver zoning code greatly increased the menu of available zone districts with the hope that customized zoning would be less necessary and given the many more standard options now available that could be tailored best to a community needs. Further blueprint Denver explicitly recommends against the use of custom zoning solutions such as PUDs when standard zone district solutions are available due to the problems that arise in consistency and efficiency of administration among other challenges. So I just wanted to point out that that recommendation for a PUD approach would seem to be outdated with current plans. And while a mixed use zone district is not a residential zone district, the EMX3 does not preclude the development of residential uses. And in fact the applicant is again not germane to this reasoning application but the applicant is proposing to develop for multi-family sorry multi-unit residential in this area. Criteria two, there are no waivers or special considerations being made. It will be a standard zone district being adopted which is consistent with uniformity of district regulations. Number three, furthering of public health safety and welfare. This rezoning is consistent with this criteria primarily through implementation of adopted plans and allowing for mixed use zone districts which enable a mix of uses

on one zone law that allows people to live work and play in the same area, reducing car trips and achieving improved public health outcomes for justifying circumstances. A significant portion of the parcel is retained former chapter 59 zoning in the form of ED 550. So that in and of itself is a justifying circumstance to get it into a new DZC standard zone district. And the applicants also note the change to such a degree that the proposed rezoning is in the public interest and that is specific to the E-S-U-D-X parcel to on the eastern edge of the proposed rezoning. Def also finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the neighborhood context, zone district purposes and intent. The requested EMX zone district is within the urban edge neighborhood context. Again, it generally consists of single and two unit residentials with uses with small scale multi-unit residential uses and commercial areas typically embedded in the residential areas. And the general purpose for the mixed use zone districts is stated in the DZC is to promote safe active and pedestrian scaled diverse areas through the use of building forms that clearly define and activate the public street edge and ensure new development contributes positively to established residential neighborhood and character and improves the transition between commercial development and adjacent residential neighborhoods. I also wanted to take this moment to clarify that this parcel would be subject to protected district standards as it is surrounded by some single unit and two unit zoning. So keep that in mind as well. And again, talking about the EMX-3 district specifically, it applies to areas or intersections served primarily by collector or arterial streets. We're building scale of one to three stories is desired and the property to be rezoned is on Alameda Avenue, which is classified as a mixed use arterial street and the desired building heights articulated in the adopted plans are up to five stories. And again, the request here is only to go to three. CBD recommend City Council approve the application based on finding that all review criteria have been met. The applicants are available for questions as am I. Thank you. All right. Thank you, James. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 966. And we have six individuals signed up to speak this evening. And I'd like to remind the speakers to please give us your name and city of residents. And our first speaker is going to be Brent Bartels. Madam President, Brent is with the applicant team. I perhaps he's not prepared to offer testimony at this time. It should be on the line. Yeah. Check in with the staff. We want to at least since we're in the public hearing portion have Brent come on up because if he'll answer questions, we want to acknowledge him. And so we'll go ahead and try to get it's not looking like we have Brent. So we'll go ahead and move on to Brian Connolly. Good evening, Madam President, members of Council. This is Brian Connolly with the law from a bot in Johnson. I'm the projects land use attorney and Brent and I are both on for the purpose of answering questions. So I'll leave it at that. And major Richard Pease of the Salvation Army is I'm going to be giving the applicant presentation. All right. Hi, major Richard Pease. I reside in Lakewood. Oh, you know what? We're going to go ahead, Mr. Pease. We have you scheduled a bit further down. So we'll go ahead and come back to you here. Next up, we have Jesse Paris first. Go ahead, Jesse. It was a council of watch to them to Michelle Paris and I live in district eight in Denver, Colorado. And I'll represent for Denver. So hello, Black Star excellent for self-defense cause of advancing commitment for social change, as well as the unity party of Colorado and my news. Now we'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. I've got a few questions for the occupant with this reason. I want to know exactly what it's going to be here. I've seen something about mixed use, commercial. Is it going to be shops? Is it going to be a mix of housing and shops? If there's going to be housing, what is going to be the AMI level for the housing? If there's not going to be housing, what kind of shops are going to be present? And how long? If there's not some, would it be actually affordable? Would it be for 20 years, 60 years, 100 years? And was there a traffic study done? So I'll complete answer those questions. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Jesse. Next

up, now we have Richard Pease. Go ahead, sir. And we're going to need to go ahead, Richard, and have you unmute? All right. Have you got me there now? Yep. Go ahead. Great. So I'm Major Richard Pease with the Salvation Army. I'm a resident of Lakewood, but I do work at the Salvation Army on 1370 Pennsylvania Street here in downtown Denver. So honorable members of City Council. It's my privilege to represent the Salvation Army this evening. I would just share with you that we are committed to serving our neighbors in need in the Denver metro area, having been here since 1887, keeping our promise of doing the most good for our community. And we plan to do so for at least the next 133 years. We are seeking this rezoning as our property is currently under a very restrictive PUD, which effectively only allows for what is currently built on the site and present and prevents us from best serving the needs of Denverites. The proposed EMX-3 zone district would allow us to build housing first trauma-informed model bridge housing, providing comprehensive case management for up to 85 homeless families at a time, enabling them to get back on their feet to build a new core community center, which would be a gathering place for the neighborhood, providing after school programs, a gymnasium that the community may use, programs for seniors, and much more, and to build a new regional headquarters and administration building on our property. While Blueprint Denver height guidance calls for up to five stories on this site, we believe the proposed zone district allows for a project that will provide significant community benefits while being in line with the character of the neighborhood. We're particularly excited about the opportunity to build the new bridge housing, which will expand on the success of our existing Lambeth Family Center at 29th and Federal. Last year, 79 families were served using the housing first trauma-informed care model, and 98% of them exited into permanent, stable housing. Giving the current circumstances, we believe, more strongly than ever, that housing like this will be necessary for families in the years to come. We also believe that this will be a win for the residents of the City and County of Denver. Building on our existing partnership with Denver, working together, we will continue to address the issue of homelessness among families and a housing first trauma-informed care model that seeks to break the cycle of poverty and meet people where they are at. Together, we can provide life-transforming services to our neighbors in need. We hope to have your support, and we are happy to answer any questions that you may have on this rezoning proposal. Thank you. Our last speaker is Comrade Defense. Hello, City and Council of Denver. Fuck you, Major, whatever, from the Salvation Army. 75 families, really? 75 families. Today alone, myself and some Comrade fed over 200 individuals and families. I distributed over $300 worth of emergency winter gear that the City and County of Denver fails to do. It is going to be freezing tonight. It is wet outside. People are going to die and we are talking about rezoning. We are talking about pedestrian-friendly walkways, which really is just a racist term and a way in which you are going to prevent homeless people from being able to find somewhere to survive. Fuck you, Major. We would ask you to please address. You need to figure out how to better serve the City. These are residents. They are human beings, people. It is not property over people. It is people over property. I am ashamed of how this City is falling apart. Fences everywhere. What is this? The Hunger Games? We are asking you to please keep on the rezoning for the rezoning. Sitting warm in your houses. Dry. Cozy. While thousands are freezing. Wet. You can ask me to be nice. I don't give a fuck. I have expressed in my first amendment, right? We've got the merits of the rezoning. Fuck you, Madam President. Fuck you. Until you start helping the on-house. The merits of the rezoning. All right. Thank you. That concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council, Councilwoman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. My first question is for James from CPD. One of the things that you mentioned wasn't something I have a lot of understanding about. It was the subject to protected district standards. Can you describe that a little bit more for me? Absolutely. The protected districts are any of our single unit or two unit districts within the city of Denver. The protected district standards are specifically designed for those single and two unit zone districts that are adjacent

to non protected districts. Adjacent to mixed use zone districts or commercial zone districts or something like that. I don't have them memorized, but there are a series of setbacks and setbacks and things that are designed to allow light access and deference in general to the single unit and two unit zone districts in recognition of it being a, you know, there being a transition area from community corridor areas to more residential areas. What would that look like with this particular project? So that would look like, as I sort of mentioned, enhanced setbacks and and step backs in bulk planes to properties. So this is, there are single unit districts to the specifically to the north up a map for you. So again, to the northwest and east, there are single unit zone districts in direct proximity to this parcel. So they would have to comply with additional setback and bulk plane requirements. I don't have them pulled up off the top of my head, but it's just in even in big picture, not really knowing what like blueprints or what they're exactly planning. The prop, there's a big green, there's a big open field in a large part of the property. If they were to build something there, are you talking about for three stories, it wouldn't be three stories right up to the house, it would have. Yes, that's exactly, that's exactly what we're talking about. Okay. Okay. And major, I'm sorry, Mr. Pease, the question around the project that you're, you're hoping to build. I'm thrilled about the perspective of the community center there, the bridge housing. It really is one of those housing components that's desperately needed. I am curious, though, about the potential of it not getting built and what would happen to the property in that circumstance. So Council member, we would not proceed with construction until we have the funds for the project. And unless we do the project, we don't plan on making any changes to the property. So we've been there since the 70s and we're not planning on going anywhere. We just want to improve the services that we provide on our property. Okay. Madam President, I think those were all of my questions for now. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres, Councilwoman Ortega, you're up. Thank you, Madam President. My first question is for James. James, on this particular site, will there be a separate curb cut into the property or will they have to pull in off one of the side streets? I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's going to require any approvals from CDOT. I believe this is a state highway corridor. It could be wrong about that, but wanted to get your input on that. Thank you for the question, Councilwoman Ortega. I do not know the answer to that question and I would be happy to try and find it out for you. Okay. I know with some of our projects that we've done in various areas of the city where it does require a curb cut. Sometimes CDOT hasn't always been that cooperative and I'm not sure Mr. Pijo may be able to speak to kind of where the traffic will come off of Elameda into the site. Sure. I would just we would continue to use the curb cut that we have that goes to our existing senior residents. That would be the main curb cut. We do also actually have three three on the property already and we're actually going to be taking that down to two. So certainly that all I believe happened during the design phase. Okay. And so besides the 85 units, first of all, can you talk about what the bedroom sizes are that you're looking at and then is there any other anticipated housing besides those 85 units? So certainly the current plans are still in development but we're looking at a 450 square foot apartment per family that has the bedrooms and bathroom in it and then there would be no additional housing on the campus. So those aren't very big families if they're only 450 square feet. They're about twice the size of our current rooms at the Lambeth family center. Okay. Okay. Let's see. So will you be looking to get any low income tax credits for the project? We would certainly be open to any funding opportunities that would be available. And I would also, I'm sorry, go ahead, council member. No, I'm just asking if you have someone on your team that's familiar with the low income tax credit process because it can be very cumbersome and it's rare that an applicant gets funding their first time out of the shoot. It also requires support from

the city. If you're going to be asking for any city financing because that helps sort of, you know, kind of line you up for for a greater approvals at the at the chaffa level. Sure. We do have legal counsel that's familiar with the low income housing tax credit process and we have been successful in other jurisdictions in obtaining that. So we're confident that if we were to move in that direction, we could be successful in partnering with the city on getting that. And then if I could just going back to your question about the unit sizes, I did want to mention that we are actually designing the property as well to have all of the units be interconnected with adjoining doors so that as family sizes change, we could scale up to give them two of the units if it's a, you know, a six or eight member family. So we certainly wouldn't expect a large family to be put into a small space. Right. Okay. So the commercial space, a lot of that will be your admin office is moving to the campus still. Is that correct? Correct. So the the we are moving our divisional headquarters, which serves as the regional administration for Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and half of Montana onto the property. We are taking it down from our current size, partly because of COVID and partly because of the the requirements of the property. But it will give us a more cost effective way to serve the community and probably reuse a building we have on Capitol Hill that there are others in the community that could make better use of it than us. I was going to ask if that if this project is contingent on selling that property, or do you intend to continue to keep and utilize it for other purposes within your Salvation Army family? Sure. We do plan on on selling that property. We believe that there are significant folks in the community that would love to to be there and would provide a significant funding towards the project for the privilege. Okay. Thank you. Those are all the questions I have, Madam President. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Madam President. James, maybe you could address just the basic question for me on the selection of the EMX-3 zone for this. Did you, were any other zone designations considered with the applicant? There's already a five-story building on the site. Six stories, if you go on the north side downhill, and EMX-3 is one to three stories. So I'm just wondering, does the existing building become a non-conforming use, or was there some other zone designation that was that was discussed here? What an excellent question. Let me go to some of my hidden slides. I ask only excellent questions. The reason I ask is because if it does become a non-conforming use in an EMX-3, there might be restrictions on alterations or changes to the existing building that might, in the future, be problematic. I'm just wondering if that was discussed and vetted. Yes, sir. So this question came up at Planning Board as well. I've pulled the relevant zone section or definition. So the five-story structure would become a compliant structure, which is a structure that was legally established, that meets one of these two following conditions. So in this fall to number two, the legally established structure was conforming under former Chapter 59 on June 24, 2010, but does not currently comply with in resoning code building height standards, citing form standards or design element form standards. So we have, there are different levels of conforming compliance, illegal, irregular. This is the most lenient of those forms. They would not have issues. They couldn't put a sixth or seventh story on top of it, obviously, but they would not have issues in modifying the existing structure. Okay. That was my one concern with this. Thank you, Madam President. That's all. All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Sandoval. Thank you, Madam Chair. So my question is for the Salvation Army. You have your, you used to be headquarters in Gloville, correct off of Pennsylvania. Yeah, but you had a site down there. Okay. If you're referring to our adult rehabilitation center that was at the right below where 25 and 70 cross, that's actually a different part of the Salvation Army. That wasn't a facility under our purview. What part can you explain that in a different way? Sure. We have an adult rehabilitation center command that handles all of our adult rehabilitation centers in the 13 western United States. And that is while we're one Salvation Army, we have different departments, as you can imagine, we're pretty, pretty significant

sized. And so they handle the alcohol rehabilitation program. So that was their men's residence that is temporarily suspended operations while we're trying to find, they're trying to find a new location and restart that program. They do still have a women's residence here in operation in northeast of near Westminster. Okay. Thank you. How can we guarantee that you won't sell this land now that I know you've been here for a long time, but in, if you look at the redevelopment of Denver as a whole, zone districts that are re-zoned to three stories have the most desirability through developers. So I'm just going to, did you talk about adding a development agreement with the Office of Housing and Stability? Did you talk about entering into some type of housing agreement or development agreement so that we can guarantee that the actual affordability of this land will be there? Oh, there you go, Brian. Yeah. Councilman Sandoval, this is Brian Connolly, land use attorney for the project. We did have those conversations, as I think you're aware at the LUTI committee hearing that the idea of having a development agreement that would basically obligate the Salvation Army to remain at this property was discussed. And we explored that with the city attorney's office. And I will just say that the Salvation Army was willing to enter into some type of agreement like that. The reality is that under both city and state law, zoning regulates uses, not users. And so the city doesn't actually have the authority to enter into an agreement that would obligate a particular user to remain at the property. Now, with respect to the question of whether... Talking about, so you're speaking to a different type of development agreement. I would never want a development agreement that says the Salvation Army had to stay on the land. That's ridiculous. I'm talking about a development agreement that the city often times enters into, where it requires affordability for the developer. I would never... So if you were talking about a type of development agreement that made the Salvation Army stay with the land, that's like not legal. But I'm talking about a type of development agreement that says, if you redevelop this land, you will develop 80% units at... Or 10, 20% units at 80% AMI. That happens all the time. Yeah, and where that happens, and I guess I would also ask a member of the city attorney's office to speak to this, where that typically happens is where there's an up-zoning occurring, where there's a height increase that goes over and above what Blueprint Denver calls for. And my understanding is that it's not the city's practice to require that, where you have a zoning designation that generally complies with the Blueprint designation as is the case here. Well, that's new to me. So I've never heard that before, because you can't get a rezoning if you don't follow Blueprint Denver standards. So each applicant has to be within the recommendations within Blueprint Denver. So it would be odd for us to be approving something that goes above and beyond the recommendations of Blueprint Denver. So all the zoning stay within the form of Blueprint Denver. And I'm working on several in my council districts. So contrary to your belief, we enter into these all the time at Denver City and the City and County of Denver does. Correct. And your code criteria, though, don't contemplate entry into a development agreement as just a matter of course. No, you're correct. It's not required. There's nothing that is required right now because of the Telluride Agreement until the state amends the Telluride. I'm asking why you didn't voluntarily do that. If that is your mission for the Salvation Army, it doesn't seem like it would be above and beyond anything that goes beyond the mission of the Salvation Army. It actually seems like it is in alignment with the Salvation Army and their mission to house those most vulnerable in who need housing. So I'm just wondering why it wasn't done. Like I say, Councilman Sandoval, we offered that we were willing to enter into this agreement. We were told that this was not a circumstance in which the city would enter into this type of agreement. So I guess I would defer to staff for the City Attorney's Office for further explanation. And Councilman Sandoval, we have Adam Hernandez from the City Attorney's Office. I don't think it, but with all due respect, Madam President, it's not Adam Hernandez. It would be with someone, Britta, because oftentimes we enter into our development agreements with the Office of Housing Stability. We don't enter into the agreements with Adam Hernandez. So I'll just, I'll quit

asking my questions, but I just find it interesting that you were not willing to enter into a development agreement when you are rezoning and you are upzoning the rest of the land from the current PUD. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval. And James, I think we can go ahead and have you stop sharing your screen for us. Thank you for putting up the compliance structure slide up. All right. And our next question is from Councilman Kneach. Thank you, Madam President. A couple of the questions here, I think might be clarified by a little more clarity on the type of housing. So major P's, you use this term bridge housing, which kind of is, you know, I think it may be an insider term. Can you clarify a little bit about the difference between bridge housing and like what we would consider permanent housing that is an apartment with a kitchen that, you know, so tax credits, for example, and some of the types of housing agreements we're describing are generally for permanent housing where a family has a lease and they get to stay until, you know, the end. And so can you just, I think, talk a little bit more about bridge housing and what it is and how it's different? I'd be happy to. So bridge housing, which uses the housing first trauma informed care model is specifically designed to be 90 days or less. So the idea here is not that we're building transitional housing that's up to two years, which is, as you mentioned, one of the requirements generally of low income housing tax credits, which is why we've thought about it, but not really explored that too deeply. That is the model that we use at Lambeth, which is very successful. And we believe that in moving forward with that model, if we expand to 85 units, we could conceivably, for those who don't know, Lambeth family center has 20 units. So we're talking over four times the number of units, which means that we could conceivably help four times as many families each and every year with our bridge housing, which, as I said, is up to 90 days, offers intensive case management. We also do some case management after the fact, combined with several other programs that we do, as well as other providers in the Metro Denver homeless initiative and the various partners that we have, including the city and county of Denver and with host. Is that helpful? Council member? I hope so. Thank you. I'll save the rest for comments. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines. Thank you, Madam President. Major Peace. Do you currently serve anyone who needs this housing? Is there anyone that you might turn away who might apply or be interested in this housing? No, Council member, we, our mission is to meet human need without discrimination. So we do not turn folks away. I do know that we do work very closely with coordinated entry to make sure that folks are coming through both coming through coordinated entry so that we can make sure they have access to all of the resources that are available throughout Denver Metro. That's just more of a technical side of things, but we definitely do not turn away folks that are in need. So there's there aren't any classes or protected classes like the LGBT community, except anyone who applies. Or anyone who meets the qualification space available? Yeah, typically the qualification is that space is available and you generally have to be literally homeless or we have a referral through coordinated entry. So other than that, to be honest, we don't ask any of those other questions because they're not relevant when someone is homeless or hungry or cold or needing, needing housing. Thank you, Major. I would agree. One other question. What about accessibility for people with disabilities, who people who have mobility impairments or intellectual disabilities, is that are you considering that population as well? We are as we as we develop the program elements. Certainly, this is kind of an ongoing process to improve that. Certainly, the building will be built to all ADA specifications and then from a program's perspective, we will make sure that we tailor that's part of the housing first trauma informed care piece that goes into that. And I have we have several experts in our social services department that work with that. And certainly we work with host as well and would collaborate on making sure that we met those needs. Yeah, thank you again, Major, for those comments. I think I actually saw you on the sidewalk in front of your location in Capitol

and that's my district. And I think you were just you have to be walking by as I was rolling by. So could could be I like walking out for lunch occasionally, especially down to the Great Wall. They have good orange chicken. Yeah. I I I I've heard I've heard people come from all the metro area to to that particular Chinese restaurant. So but I your your location in Capitol is a gem. I'll just I'll just put at that. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Major Pease, what's the space the square footage of the open space that you have now? I would have to defer to my team because I'm not sure I don't have that number off the top of my head. So either Brent or Brian, does one of you have that number? I don't have the current open space on the property. I think Brent might be on. He may be a participant and with his hand raised. That's okay. I don't need an exact figure off topic. I'm just wondering if you had or the Salvation Army had considered whether or not this space could be used for an open campsite like a safe outdoor camping location. We have not discussed that with the Safe Outdoor Spaces Committee. Would you mind if I followed up with you about that? Sure. I'd be happy to to discuss that with you, Council Member. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Torres. All right. Seeing no other questions from my colleagues, the public caring for Council Bill 20-0966 is closed. Comments by members of Council, Council Member Torres. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the amount of engagement that the Salvation Army has done with neighbors and through a number of back and forth comments. I think it was really important that all of the property owners and residents that surround this property and in what is now a pretty large, wide open space know and appreciate kind of what your vision is and what you're hoping to build. 85 units is 85 units and I think everyone is necessary and needed. I appreciate the work that you've all undertaken to try to bring that to reality. Thank you, Madam President. And I look forward to supporting the project. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres. Councilwoman Kenich. Thank you, Madam President. I also just want to thank the team for having done outreach extensively over, I think probably well over a year ago, if not longer ago, that I first heard about this. You know, the inclusion of a range of services, right? It's hard to believe gymnasiums, right? This moment, right? It feels very far away in our future, but we know that more than ever kids will need places to go to recreate when they can safely. And, you know, in particular, I think that bridge housing is an example of the range of options we need. We have a lot of families that, you know, kind of fall off the cliff of motel and shelter before they're able to get the permanent housing. And so that word bridge, it literally means kind of that filling of that gap. And so, you know, I do think that your history in the city and, you know, appreciate the experience you all have had running emergency camps in other countries for those who are refugees of war and civil unrest. And in our case, we have economic conditions here. And so, you know, I also am assured, I appreciated the questions about not turning anyone away. Although our federal government took a minute to try to undo a number of anti-discrimination provisions in the shelter arena, which I think bridge housing will more likely fit under that than housing. But we also have state public accommodations laws that cover the full range of housing. And so if anyone needs reassurance about that, we've spent a lot of time over the past few years educating providers on the range of anti-discrimination protections. So I'm excited that we are moving forward with this rezoning today that meets the criteria in particular for the land use change proposed. But it's always great when the use is also something our community needs. So thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman Knich. And I'll go ahead and chime in as well. But based on the criteria, this rezoning meets all of the guidelines that are laid out for it. And I would encourage folks to support it. Madam Secretary, roll call. All right. Hi. Black. Hi. See the bar guy. Clark. Hi. Quinn. Hi. Hi. Herndon. Hi. Chime. Hi. Cashman. Hi. Knich. Hi. Ocega. Hi. Deendoval. Hi. Sawyer. Hi. Madam President. Aye.

Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce results. Hello, right. 12 ayes. Council Bill 966 has passed. Council Member Black, will you please put Council Bill 1027 on the floor for final passage? Yes, Madam President. I move that Council Bill 20-1027 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Been moved and seconded. You've got either Herndon or Heinz. Herndon. Herndon. Thank you, Councilman Herndon. The combined public carrying for Council Bill 1027 and Council Bill 1028 is open. Speakers may offer comments on either or both items. After the conclusion of the public carrying, Council will vote separately on each. May we please have the staff report and we have Liz Weigel up. Good evening. Thank you, Madam President and Council members. Can you see my presentation? Go ahead, Liz. This presentation will cover both the Text Amendment and map amendment, both of which are sponsored by Councilwoman Amanda Sandoval, in order to allow accessory dwelling units or ADUs in the Chaffee Park neighborhood. The Text Amendment creates a new zone district, the ESUB1 District, which would allow accessory dwelling units on single unit residential lots with a minimum lot size of 4,500 square feet. The map is amendment rezones all single unit residential districts in Chaffee Park to allow accessory dwelling units. While I'm presenting the two amendments concurrently, the Text Amendment must be considered for approval first. This will allow consideration of the map amendment pending the establishment of the new zone district. The proposed rezoning is located within Council District 1 in the Chaffee Park neighborhood. It includes the area in Chaffee Park that has residential zoning. This includes approximately 1,400 parcels bounded by Federal Boulevard, Osage Street, 52nd Avenue, and Interstate 70. The proposed map amendment intends to rezone properties between Federal and Tahon that are currently ESUDX to ESUD1X, properties between Tahon and Pecos Street that are currently ESUB to the proposed ESUB1 zone district. The properties between Pecos and Osage that are currently ESUD to ESUD1. The proposed zone districts are the same as the current zone districts except that they would allow accessory dwelling unit use either within the primary structure or in a detached structure. Similarly, the new ESUB1 district would retain the same standards of the ESUB district but would allow that ADU use. I'll go over the existing context. The proposed rezoning area is currently ESUB, ESUD, and ESUDX as I mentioned. All three zone districts are single unit residential districts and they allow the urban house primary building form with a maximum height of 30 to 35 feet. The ESUDX district also allows the suburban house primary building form. There is a view plane in this portion of this area that starts at the park at 451st and Zuni Street and extends towards downtown. This results in building height limits ranging from approximately 34 feet at the south end of the park to approximately 79 feet towards interstate 70. This range of heights generally exceeds the allowable maximum height for both the current and proposed zone districts and does not impact the rezoning. In terms of existing land use, the area is predominantly single unit residential land use that you can see in yellow on this map. There are a few public and quasi-public uses throughout and the proposed rezoning is adjacent to commercial office mixed use park and open space and some industrial uses. Here are some images from within the proposed rezoning with examples from each of the three zone districts and here are some images from surrounding areas. The council office worked closely with the Chaffee Park neighborhood association and began outreach for this rezoning last fall. This outreach included flyers, canvassing, two town holes and an online survey. We also took the text amendment to the INC zoning and planning committee in July of this year. The application was formally submitted in May of 2020 and on September 16th the planning board voted unanimously to recommend approval for 12 speakers of that hearing, 10 in support and two in opposition. CPD has received a letter of support from the Chaffee Park neighborhood association. We also received 26 comments in support from members of the public citing a desire and appropriateness for ADUs in this neighborhood and the importance of ADUs as a tool to promote affordability and aging in place opportunities. We've also received six comments in opposition citing concerns around parking, density, neighborhood character and short-term rentals. Because this rezoning is legislative it is only subject to three review criteria shown here. Text amendment is subject to the same criteria so I will discuss them together. The first is consistency with adopted plans. So if we do find that the proposed text and map amendments are consistent with several strategies from

CompPlan 2040 shown here and there are a few that I'll call out specifically. The amendments are consistent with these two equity strategies because the text amendment creates a new zone district that will allow ADUs and the map amendment enables ADUs in the entire neighborhood. ADUs can provide additional housing options including those for seniors and families and they can provide residents more flexibility to remain in their homes. The amendments are consistent with our climate strategy because they will allow additional housing units on lots with existing houses where we have existing infrastructure and services such as sewer, water and transit in place. In Blueprint Denver the this area is called as an urban edge context. The proposed zone districts are consistent with this plan direction which would remain predominantly residential with single and two unit uses. The proposed zone district are consistent with the future places mapping which is called out as low residential and described as single and two unit and places where accessory dwelling units are appropriate. There are some residential collectors and arterials in the area but most of the streets and the rezoning are undesignated locals. Under the Blue Point Growth Strategy these areas are expected to see 10% of job growth and 20% of housing growth by 2040. The additional accessory dwelling units permitted by the rezoning would be consistent with that growth strategy. The amendments are also consistent with additional strategies in Blueprint. These are detailed in the staff report that I'll briefly summarize them here. A policy four of our land use and built form section states that we should diversify housing choice by through the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all our residential areas in the city. Policy 11 recommends that we implement Blueprint's plan recommendations through large scale legislative rezoning which should include community input and be guided by our equity concepts. Policy 5 focuses on the importance of mitigating involuntary displacement which I'll discuss in the next few slides. Similar to the rezoning you just heard, text amendments and large map amendments should be guided by our equity concepts in Blueprint Ever. The first of which I'll go over is access to opportunity. This is a composite score that includes our neighborhood equity index, also proximity to high capacity frequent transit and access to centers and corridors. The Chatting Park neighborhood has moderate scores in this category with access to rail transit lower and access to centers and corridors varying throughout the neighborhood. The text amendments create ESUB-1. We'll create a new zone district within our urban edge context to allow ADUs which would allow more residents to live in neighborhoods with access to amenities and quality of life infrastructure. The proposed rezoning in Chatting Park will bring more residents to an area that has access to healthcare, high life expectancy, and it does have access to bus transit and corridors and centers and some portions of the neighborhood. The proposed rezoning will not have a direct impact on creating new corridors or centers as it will only allow residential uses. The second equity concept is vulnerability to involuntary displacement. And this is a score that includes our median household income, percent of renter occupied units, and the percent of residents of less than a college degree. Chatting Park is more vulnerable based on median household income and education levels, as shown in bold on the slide. It does have high home ownership. The text amendment will allow more properties in the urban edge context neighborhoods to establish an ADU on their property, which can be an important opportunity to build wealth and help keep current residents in place. It also provides more options for households for vulnerable to displacement to stay in the neighborhood. The proposed map amendment will similarly provide opportunities for existing homeowners to supplement their income while also increasing housing options and allowing a greater range of incomes to live in the neighborhood. The third equity concept is housing diversity. This includes five measures, including the percent of middle density housing, home size, diversity, or bedroom size, ownership versus rental, housing costs, and the number of income restricted units. Chatting Park is considered not diverse for the three measurements shown in bold. The text amendment will expand housing diversity by allowing a new housing option that is typically smaller and at a different price point than existing single unit homes, often found in urban edge neighborhoods. The map amendment to allow ADUs will introduce a new housing type to Chatting Park and bring more renters to a largely owner occupied single unit residential neighborhood. The last equity concept is jobs diversity. This map shows the mix of jobs in areas of the city with the dominant industry depicted by color. Chatting Park

shows a greater proportion of retail and manufacturing jobs compared to the city overall. The text and map amendments will have an negligible impact on jobs diversity as they are residential districts. I will also cover housing inclusive Denver. This plan was adopted in 2018 and contains recommendations that are relevant to the text and map amendment. The plan recommends expanding the development of accessory dwelling units as they incentivize affordable and mixed-use housing. It also promotes their development as a wealth building tool for low and moderate income homeowners. The proposed text and map amendment expand access to ADUs and are therefore consistent with these recommendations. In terms of the additional criteria, we define that the amendments will result in uniform regulations applicable to all new development within the urban edge zone districts. The proposed text amendment and map amendment will further public health safety and general welfare by implementing Blue Print Denver. The proposed reasoning will also improve public health outcomes by allowing more residents in an area that has higher life expectancy and access to health care bus transit and centers and corridors. It will also further the general welfare of the city by providing more housing diversity and opportunities to help residents at a range of income levels continue to live in the neighborhood. Given the finding that all review criteria have been met, staff does recommend approval of both the text amendment and the map amendment. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Liz, for the staff report. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 1027, nor Council Bill 1028, and we have seven individuals signed up to speak this evening, and we will start out with Jason Hornyak. Hi there. Sorry about that. Good evening. My name is Jason Hornyak, and I live at 50th and Decatur Street. I'm on the board of the JV Park Neighborhood Association, and I'm the leader of our ADU Task Force, so I'm delighted by the opportunity to speak and support of both items on this historic bill. This vote is a culmination of a two-year effort that began when multiple residents approached the R&O asking how they could build an ADU on their property. After consulting with CPD and examining the comprehensive plan, we realized that the best path forward would be to pursue a mass legislative rezoning with the help of our City Council office. With their leadership, we performed extensive outreach in the neighborhood, and I'm very proud that we were able to show that a majority of our residents are in favor of this gentle increase in density. The physical character of JV Park hasn't changed that much since it was built in the 1940s, but the situation around it has changed quite a bit. This neighborhood was on the edge of town known it was built, but it's now just two neighborhoods away from the downtown of a major American city with the miles of sprawl on the other side. Even though JV Park's built environment remains stable, despite all this external change, our land values have skyrocketed, which has caused economic and social instability for our residents. Under our current zoning code, our residents only have two options to deal with this instability. Stay and try to keep up with their rising property taxes, or they can cash in and sell their property and move away. We're trying to give people a third option, one where they can capitalize on the increasing land value without having to move out, an option that could allow them to alleviate the pressures of increasing housing costs and provide care for their extended family without sacrificing their independence. An option that won't benefit them won't just benefit them as the owner of the property, but will benefit the person that rents it as well by providing them a reasonably priced home. This option allows us, the residents of JV Park, to do something this city has been struggling with for years, providing more housing. Legalizing ADUs will give us that option. So I won't directly benefit from this bill as I won't be building an ADU on my property, but I strongly believe that my neighbors should have the right to do so if they choose, because I realize that this is bigger than me as an individual, and it's bigger than us as a neighborhood. It's about the city and our land use values as a whole. We're growing so fast that attempting to live the same way we did in the past is actively harming our future. So our comprehensive plan clearly recommends that ADUs should be allowed by right everywhere in the city. I'm extremely proud of the work we did to get here tonight, and I'm very thankful for our

Councilwoman's leadership and courage, and I'm hopeful this process provides enough proof of concept that ADUs should be legalized across the whole city without having to duplicate this effort neighborhood by neighborhood. So we can instead use that time to figure out ways to make them more affordable for the people that need them the most, and that will be our next effort. So if you vote yes, of course. So thank you very much for your time. Have a good night. Thank you. Our next speaker is Fred Rick Glick. Hi. Good evening. My name is Fred Glick. I reside at 3850 North York Street in the Clayton Neighborhood Council District number nine. I'm also a property owner in the Chaffee Park neighborhood. I'm here tonight to urge you to support this combined text amendment and map amendment to allow ADUs throughout the Chaffee Park neighborhood. The application before Unite represents the outcome of an admirable and amazing public process in the R&O and Councilwoman Sandoval and her staff deserve great respect and gratitude for their efforts. There are a lot of good reasons to allow ADUs throughout the Chaffee Park neighborhood, providing opportunities for residents to age in place, helping homeowners to build their equity in their homes, enabling multi-generational and extended families to live together. The residents of Chaffee Park have also made clear that they would like the benefits of increased density, including opportunities for neighborhood retail, which would be made much more viable with increased density. When I participated in one of the public sessions organized by Councilwoman Sandoval's office in the R&O, I heard people express fears that they wouldn't know who is living in their backyards. As the owner of an ADU, I'd like to make sure it's clear. If you choose to have an ADU, you also get to choose what you do with it. Rent it out, house a family member, use it as a home office, store old newspapers in it. We rent our ADU and we used a web platform to take applications and conduct background checks on prospective tenants. We interviewed them, called references, we chose who to rent our ADU to. In approving this application, you begin to fulfill the Denver right mandate to allow ADUs throughout the city. The one-off rezoning to allow ADUs on individual properties the city is seeing more and more of are a barrier to those hoping to have ADUs. Not everyone can readily afford the fees required, and navigating the city rezoning process isn't necessarily easy. These one-off rezoning also consume considerable city resources, which I cannot believe the city comes close to recouping through the fees charged. In many respects, the application before you tonight is about equity and opportunity. Many residents, including in my own neighborhood of Clayton, see the borders between where ADUs are allowed and where they are not as arbitrary. Many of my neighbors who are on the wrong side of the line would like the opportunity to have an ADU to house an aging parent, to generate additional income, to do their part to help alleviate the housing supply crisis Denver faces. I hope you will not only approve this application, but also look at it as a model of what should come next. Whether citywide or neighborhood by neighborhood, the ability for residents to have ADUs should not be reliant upon whether they can risk the fees required, whether they feel comfortable navigating the rezoning process. I thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you. Our next speaker is Nola Miguel. Good evening council members. Nola Miguel 4930 Vallejostri. I also live in Chappie Park and I'm part of the RNO and I'm actually interested in this reason both for personal reasons and for systemic reasons that I think are important for the whole city. I would like to build a Grammy flat and I say Grammy because that's what my kids call my mom and I would like her to be able to move in my backyard ideally or any place close to us. And we have been looking around the neighborhood, walk a little distance from our house for my kids and walk over to. And there's nothing in the neighborhood that's affordable under $400,000. We've been looking at ARIA at the condos there. We look at the housing there. We're still packing over $400,000 for all of those options to retire at about two years ago from the University of Wisconsin and would like move here to be close to all of us and especially her grandchildren. And we need a different type of option. We're also, you know, we have a pretty big lot. It's 10,000 feet. I'm very interested in the idea of activating our alleyway. It's a

huge amount of space that's unused and unactivated throughout the neighborhood. I also think that we have plenty of parking. I'll just just say that throughout the neighborhood and in our front and backyard, there's parking. Systemically, I think, as you know, many have said so far, we really need affordable housing and rental options. I'm outside of just building large, large apartments and this is a great infill option. Also very thankful to Councilwoman Sandoval and her office in figuring out a solution for the east part of the neighborhood. I'm really thankful that we could do this as a comprehensive neighborhood and appreciate all your work on this. Also, just ADU should be across the city. It's a reason we've been looking at it in GES for a long time as well. But a little, there's so many pressures in GES with investments happening right now that putting another thing in there just didn't seem like quite the right time. And we really would like to see this be across the whole city instead of being neighborhood by neighborhood. Also, those support services for low income homeowners is critical, critical. We could, I've looked into how much I could get for a loan, how much we could, if we could figure this out. And we couldn't do this without the investment from my mom to be able to build this. So I think it's critical to have investment strategies to do some of the West Denver Renaissance type programming. Also, just the ADUs, if possible to have a structure that could be a one-story garage and unit on the same level, that's really the most affordable thing to build. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next speaker is Lucia Brown. Hello. My name is Lucia Brown and I live in the Baker neighborhood in Council District 7 with Joelan. And I'm also president of the Baker Historic Neighborhood Association. And we've had ADUs in Baker forever. We had carriage houses built. And so even before ADUs were allowed in the zoning, we had them here because of grandfathering. I have a carriage house in my backyard and we converted, it was my husband's office for 16 years and we just converted it over to an apartment. And not only does it provide more necessary housing in Denver, and it's an extra source of income. And so when my husband retires, we'll still have some income coming into the house. And I know that there are people who are concerned about short-term rentals and issues like that. But because Denver has such strong short-term rental laws with the property, having to be the primary residence, there really would be very little negative impact. And also the area of Chaffee County, I don't think would be a high demand area for short-term rentals. It's not like it's close to downtown or close to a lot of amenities. So it would probably be more profitable for the homeowners to lease long-term. So I just want to be on the record as saying that I fully support this text amendment change. And I agree with NOLA that this should be done city-wide and not neighborhood by neighborhood. It's a no-brainer way to do gentle increase in density and allow for different kinds of housing options and allowing people to age in place. It also deals with being grain, you know, more dense, lowers your carbon footprint. So that's where I stand. And I appreciate the council allowing us to speak on this issue. Thanks. And hi, everybody. Hello. Thank you. Next up, we have Susan Powers. Good evening, everyone. First of all, I wanted to thank Councilwoman Sandoval for bringing this forward. This is, and actually also thank the Chaffee Park Labor Association because I think they're the most thoughtful R&O in the city. And how often do you have the R&O coming here saying, yes, we approve this. We recommend this. So I'm speaking as a property owner as part of the Aria Denver development that's within Chaffee Park. But I guess I was supposed to say I live at 1475 which is District 9. The Aria Denver development, which is the 17-acre redevelopment of the former Merrycrest convent, is immediately adjacent to this area. It's part of the city in Chaffee Park. It's not part of this rezoning because it's being built out in ways where we have ADUs already there. And I am going to say to, and if she's still listening to this, that we do have an affordable co-housing unit available. So I think I have to make sure that I let that person, who was speaking earlier, know that maybe her mom can move in there. But I'm here to support this. We've been involved with

this neighborhood for over 15 years with the Merrycrest property. And we have intentionally developed it as a mixed income project. We'll end up with 40% of the units as affordable as it's developed and then it finished up in the next two years. But I think that having the ADU option here as everybody has said is gives people who are long-term homeowners in the Chaffee Park neighborhood, who are, you know, it's a neighborhood that is being impacted by the growth that's coming from the south. Build the ability to stay in their home, build a unit that might provide them with income that is necessary for them to carry on in our life in this neighborhood. I've watched this for the last however many years as things have jumped across I-70 and have been concerned about whether the character of that neighborhood was going to change, continue to change. And I think this is a way to kind of counter some of that gentrification. So I hope that you'll support this tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Allison O'Kelly. Thank you. Can you hear me all right? Go ahead. Perfect. Thank you. So my name is Allison O'Kelly. I live in the 4800 block of Decatur Street in the neighborhood as well. I bought my home a little over seven years ago right before property values started skyrocketing. So I was lucky to be able to afford a house at the time. And I'm lucky now to have realized some of those equity increases that Jason spoke about earlier this evening. I speak today in support of the neighborhood rezoning of the neighborhood. I do want to make sure I disclose that I do work in affordable housing. So I would support this gentle density increase in any neighborhood in Denver. But I do in particular as a resident of Chapee Park. I think that creating this neighborhood zoning allowance makes it possible for us to do so without creating the administrative burden that has already been discussed that is put upon the planning and zoning commission as well as any residents who would like to build an ADU. And so I think the fact that we're doing this as a neighborhood wide proposal has been a really smart thing. And I also agree with recommendations that this become a city wide approval rather than additional neighborhoods needing to go through the process that we did. I think that the height and setback limits on buildings that were discussed in the presentation earlier will ensure that there aren't any ADUs that would cause negative impacts on the adjacent homes. Like I know a number of neighborhoods have been concerned about before ADUs came in and they saw what the limits were on those. I also think that we can ensure community access and safety to the neighborhood because as NOLA said earlier, we have fairly wide streets and a lot of space for parking. Most of the houses in our neighborhood have parking both in the front and in the back. So access to those units is not going to create additional traffic and it's not going to create a lot of the ability of the residents. I think that not everybody in the neighborhood will be in a financial position to start building ADUs if this is approved. I myself wouldn't build one anytime soon. But I think it's really important the opportunity that it's going to provide to increase affordable housing in the neighborhood and homeownership stability. I think those of us who have elderly relatives in the neighborhood or in the broader metro area see this is a great opportunity to discuss with those family members the possibility of senior family members downsizing and being able to combine homes in a way that works for the entire family and while I don't see myself doing that soon my family my parents live in North Glen and they're very vital seniors now but things can always change and I like the fact that we could look at this together as a potential opportunity down the road. So I do want to thank our council member and Naomi Grenitz as well and I thank all of you for your time and hope you will support this. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker is Jesse Parris. Yeah it's good evening as a council. I was watching that phone. Can I'm hurt? My name is Jesse Parris. I'm a present for Denver Council. Well Black Starks and moving for self-defense positive vaccine climate for social change as well as the community party of Colorado and my Ohio knows and I live in district eight in Christopher Henderson's district and I will be the next

mayor of Denver in 2023. I support this rezoning tonight ADUs are one of the many housing offices I've pushed for when I ran for city council by a large last year and I am very familiar with this district because I've knocked this area two years in a row uh for candidates that ran for office most recently uh chairman St. Cooslin's room for the United States so I'm very familiar with the Chafee Park area. So I'm a council member understandable. I support this rezoning. I believe that this should pass tonight. I just had a few questions. I wanted to know what were the two letters or comments or letters of opposition at the planning meeting and what were the six letters of comments at the um at the healing that the community had in regards to these ADUs. I support ADUs. I would like to see them in every district in this town as nor in others have already stated so if someone can please answer those questions I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. All right thank you Jesse that concludes our speakers questions from members of council on council bill 1027 and or council bill 1028 I'll give it another moment for any hands raised all right see no questions of members of council the public hearing is closed comments by members of council on council bill 1027 and or council bill 1028 councilman's and of all. Thank you madam president so thank you all it's an honor to be here with for you today with this application as it's been discussed this is the first time an entire neighborhood has been rezoned to allow self-accessory rallying units and honestly I wouldn't be here today with all of you if it wasn't for the residents of chubby park they came together and approached me before I was even sworn into office to talk about how we could get this done and one of the things that we found out early on is you're voting on two things you're creating a new map a map you're creating a new zone district because on the east side of t-home the parcels are so small that there was not actually a zone district that would allow accessory dwelling units so I had to create I had to slow the process down a little bit and work with community planning and development and create equity throughout the whole entire neighborhood so the whole entire neighborhood would be able to allow it have the opportunity to have accessory dwelling units. I would also like to thank my aid council um sorry my aid Naomi Grunditz who graduated with her master's in land use planning and she and I came up with an idea on how to get involvement from the neighborhood she worked on a survey that was really well received and did a lot of the back work which I call is talking to neighbors and explaining this in a way where it's digestible. I feel like a lot of times when we're talking about rezoning and we're talking about land use we use terminology that's not very accessible and those in the city and county of Denver or those of us on city council we understand it because we have lots of meetings with planners who explain it and so I feel like it's my job to be able to explain it to everybody who would be impacted by these rezoning. So thank you Naomi for your steadfast leadership on this and I would also like to talk to Jesse's concern so some of the people who were opposed to this were nervous about um having strangers in their backyard they were nervous about parking and they were nervous about change. In northwest Denver I was born and raised there has been a lot of change. The built environment has changed drastically since the 2010 zoning code and so a lot of change change can be challenging and it can be a lot of fear-based and so we listened to everybody and I made the tough decision to move forward on the application based on the lot of the equity concepts that you would have found in the document that Liz presented and we also met with the city assessors to make sure we talked about taxes. We met with the fire department to talk about alley wits. We met with Renee Martina Stone who runs the West Denver collaborative. Renaissance collaborative who works on building ADUs in West Denver to figure out how we could work all together in Chappie Park. I had this survey in English and Spanish. We had all flyers done in English and Spanish and so we had two responses in Spanish

so that shows me that it's working as long as they can have access to the information and with that if anyone if my colleagues have anything any other comments I would absolutely really appreciate your support. This is a big deal for those who have housing over there and I'll give a personal example. I have a cousin who has Down syndrome who lives in this neighborhood and I would like his caretaker to be able to live there. We are making succession plans for him. He's one of my dear cousins. He's exactly my age in 40 and been working at McDonald's and I would like Ben and all my other relatives who live in Chappie Park to stay in this neighborhood. So with that I would ask that you support this initiative to help create some gentle density in Chappie Park and I feel like it meets all the criteria. Thank you. Thank you Councilwoman Sandoval and seeing no other hands raised for comments. I would hope that all of our colleagues do support both 1027 and 1028 and just want to give you a huge congrats Councilwoman Sandoval because this was a heavy lift and your leadership and your community engagement and to have seven speakers here to all basically be in support of it goes a long way towards your community outreach and engagement. So just want to sincerely congratulate you and the Chappie Park neighborhood that they're going to have this additional tool for gentle density in the neighborhood.

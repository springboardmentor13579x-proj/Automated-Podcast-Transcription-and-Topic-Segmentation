And what's so significant about this particular program is that they were able to complete the $2 million youth media studio at 1301 10th Avenue. They began with a facility that they broke ground in 2012 with more than a million dollars in funding from the Denver Housing Authority. And then they raised another million with gifts from Devita and Shoots Denver Public Library, Betcher, Gates Family Foundation and others. So the crews have been putting the finishing touches on the control room where a sound board that was formerly part of the phrase studio is being not so much recycled. It's pretty fancy equipment. But they've donated it to youth on record and it's a place where local producers and musicians will teach kids how to record and also learn audio engineering classes. So I am very, very proud of them and just wanted to give a shout out. Many of the kids that go to youth on record are from the Colorado High School Charter and 90% of the teens involved in youth on record are youth of color and 90% are on freer reduced lunches. So I'm very, very happy and congratulations to youth on record. Thank you, Councilor Montero. Councilor Brooks. Hey, thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to just say how thrilled I was at the event that we had in five points this weekend. The five points Jazz Festival. Come on, everybody, who's there? Who's there? One. Okay, great. We had, even though we had a rainstorm in the middle, we had 20,000 people on Welton and we were hoping for 30,000, but we'll take 20,000. It was incredible and I think, you know, so much work was done. Brooke Dilling, who was a representative from Arts and Venue, led the whole project. Norman Harris III, who is on our five points business board did a great job orchestrating everything. But the picture that I want to give you guys is being on stage when one of our many jazz performers was seeing and seeing 10 blocks wall to wall with the most beautiful presentation of people. Rich, poor, old, young, all beautiful and diverse and just so eclectic and not one problem. Not one issue the whole day. And so it was completely safe, it was a lot of fun and so I am just thrilled and I just want to say a special thanks to Kent Rice and Arts and Venue. This is their kind of largest community event and they invest over $100,000 into one day. But the economic impact is hard to track on that day because it's the gift that keeps on giving to our community in five points. So many, many thanks to Arts and Venue. Thank you. Thank you Councilman, it's a great event. And speaking of great events, I'm betting Councilman Rob's gonna talk about another one. Go ahead Councilman Rob. You read my mind Council President. I too want to talk about a fabulous event that occurred this weekend, which was the 10th anniversary Colfax marathon. I really couldn't have been prouder without doing a proclamation this year or even weeks of announcements beforehand because I know most of the runners come from Council announcements, right? But, but anyway, without my doing any of that and driving my colleagues nutty, we had over 17,000 runners participate and the event went very smoothly. All right, who here ran? Who ran? Councilwoman Sussman? No. But I'll speak about that a little bit later. That Councilwoman Sussman had family members who came to Denver for the marathon. We had great weather. Someone was responsible for that, I'm sure. A fabulous festival, 150 charity partners. And I do really want to once again, thank the Public Works Department, the Denver Police Department and our sponsors, Kaiser Permanente, which is the title sponsor, Davita, which sponsors the charity partners. And finally, the thousands of volunteers that took to put on the event. So, that's the last announcement I'll be making about the Colfax marathon from this dais. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Well, I can't let that one go by. It was a fabulous event and I was my daughter, Kate and her husband, Zach, ran in that race and told me how well organized it was. It was so well organized, 23,000 runners, I understand. And they came

through it with some excellent timing, although the looks on their faces afterwards looks as if they might be reconsidering their recreation choices. But they were very happy to be finished and congratulations to Kate and Zach. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, Councilwoman Lehman. Thank you, I just want to third this. My son, John, and his wife, Sarah, awesome, Ren. See, we might not run ourselves, but we are generation, our next generation, are real great athletes. And again, it was just a wonderful experience for both of you. Thank you, Councilwoman Lehman. Any other comments from members of Council? I'd like to add just one just to let you all know, we are off next week for the Memorial Day holiday, so we will be back on Monday, June 1st. And I'd like to make a personal announcement, so the Herndon household will be expanding by one or maybe half of a person. Next week as my wife and I are expecting a baby boy to show up, probably sometime next week, but I just wanted to say thank you to the City Council family. We got some great gifts on our registry this weekend, and so I just wanted to publicly thank you all for that. We've got everything we need. We are now just waiting on the baby. So, thank you all for that. I sincerely appreciate on behalf of my wife and our daughter Griffin, who I think is more excited than both of us combined. So, seeing no other on, we are moving to presentations. Madam Secretary, do we have any presentations? Madam Mr. President? Communications, Madam Secretary, do we have any communications? Madam Mr. President? We do have two proclamations this evening. We're gonna start with Proclamation 3-2-0. Councilwoman Shepherd, we please read Proclamation 3-2-0. Thank you, Mr. President, with pleasure. Designating May 17th through May 23rd, as Public Works Week in Denver, and congratulating the Denver Public Works Department's 10 employees of the year for 2014. Whereas in celebrating the American Public Works Association's 2015 theme of community begins here, we recognize that Denver Public Works through its 1,100 employees consistently delivers safe, high-quality, cost-effective services to the citizens of Denver. And whereas Denver Public Works services are an integral part of our residents' everyday lives, with programs that include street sweeping, recycling, refuse collection, pothole repair, and street paving, and whereas Denver Public Works enhances the quality of life in our city, by managing and maintaining public infrastructure, including city rights of way, streets, alleys, on-street parking, drainage ways, sewers, bridges, traffic signals, street markings, and signage, as well as contracting procurement, cashiering, and permitting programs that meet the needs of the public. And whereas Denver Public Works continues to make significant contributions to our built environment, managing the planning, design, and construction of public infrastructure and new transportation options, including installing Denver's first protected bikeway, and permitting the city's first on-street public bike corrals. And whereas as our city grows, Denver Public Works will work to accommodate more people with a strategic plan that focuses on smart growth, smart being an acronym, and making Denver more, and this is what it stands for, sustainable, multimodal, attractive, resilient, and transparent, and whereas the council specifically recognizes and congratulates the Denver Public Works Employees of the Year for 2014 for their achievements. Michael Lopez, Capital Projects Management, Rudy Schloze with Finance and Administration, Dwayne Fields in Fleet Management, Rachel Reyes. Oh, we've got a popular one out there. Rachel Reyes Walsh, with right-of-way enforcement and permitting. Stephen Forvili, right-of-way services. Sarah Anderson with Policy, Planning, and Sustainability. Rosaleo Villalobos, Solid Waste Management. Larry Lovato with Street Maintenance. Rachel Bronson in Transportation and Danny Lopez with Waste Water Management. Now therefore be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver Section One that the Council designates the week of May 17 through May 23, 2015 as Public Works Week in Denver and congratulates the 2015 Public Works Employees of the Year and their outstanding contributions to the department and the city. Section Two that the clerk of the City and County of Denver shall attest and affix the seal of the City and County of Denver to this proclamation and that copies here of be forwarded to Denver Public Works and the 10 Public Works employees listed above. Thank you, Council Member Shepherd, your motion to adopt. I move that we adopt Proclamation Number 320, series of 2015. Second and move, then seconded, comments from members of Council, Council Member Shepherd. Thank you, Mr. President. It's such a pleasure to be able to read this proclamation again this year. I am Chair of the Infrastructure and Culture Committee and Transportation Planning and all the work, the good work that we

do in Public Works is really a specialty interest of mine and a lot of people don't know this, but Public Works is the second biggest part of our city budget on an annual basis, just after the Public Safety Department. And when it's working well, we don't hear much from the public, but we do hear when they're upset about things. But the great news is, is that every time that your trash is picked up or that your sewer works the way it's supposed to or that you arrive on time and safely at work or at school or any other parts of your destination during the day, the reason that you got there or the reason that those things were achieved is because of the hard work of our second largest department in the city and county of Denver. I just can't speak highly enough for this department and I think you guys are kind of the unsung heroes, so I'm really glad we're taking this time today to recognize all of the really hard and valuable work that you do to make this city work. And I travel a lot, I travel in the United States a lot, but I also travel in a fair number of developing countries and I'm always really struck by the way, by the contrast between the way our infrastructure works so well here in the United States and in Colorado specifically, as compared to some of the other cities and countries around the world that I have visited, which also have nice features as well, but perhaps things working on time correctly, safely and efficiently may not be some of those strengths in other areas of the world. So I'm very thankful for the work that you all do and I'm especially proud of the growth that we have made in the last few years in terms of really promoting an agenda that helps promote safety for pedestrians and cyclists and the work that we have made to push the boundaries in this area in Denver in the last few years is really great and it's also been a big focus of many members of this council as evidenced by our budget retreats in the last few years. So thank you all so much for all your work and I'm sure that some of my colleagues might have some comments as well to make, but it's great to see you in chambers tonight. Thank you Councilwoman Shepherd. Any other comments? Proclamation 320. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to also weigh in and first of all thank Councilwoman Shepherd for bringing this forward once again. I think it's vitally important to be able to recognize our city employees for the incredible work that is done day in and day out that keeps the city looking clean and great. I know the issue of filling those potholes continues to be a challenge, especially as we continue to have rain, but the work that's done of all of the different public works divisions, if you will, is such an important part of the basic services that are public or constituents come to expect. They believe that their taxpayer dollars pay for those services and if it were not for all of you sitting in the audience today and your colleagues who make this work happen and ensuring that everything works the way it's supposed to. When people's toilets flush, when they turn on the water, our draining systems throughout the city, through our tributaries, all of that is part of the work that our city employees do for us. And I just want to say a big thank you. Congratulations to the honorees, but congratulations to all of you for the work that you do every day. Thank you, Mr. President. Councilman Artega. Councilman Navett. Thank you, Mr. President. I will echo but not repeat what my colleagues have said very eloquently. I just ask that whoever comes up to speak to the proclamation, I assume it'll be manager Cornejo that he'll introduce these awardees individually so we get a chance to thank them directly. Thank you, Councilman Navett. Councilwoman Montero. Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to extend my congratulations to all of you. For the general public, there are so many divisions that are within public works. For example, Solid Waste. I'm so happy that we have roll out barrels now in Glove-Lilary, Swansea, and now La Malincan wants them. So that's something that Councilman Lopez will work on. And wastewater and traffic management and I'm sure that there's other divisions that I'm forgetting, but I just want to say that as was mentioned earlier, many times to keep things running smoothly, you don't hear from

people and you don't hear them call and say, do you really did a good job today? I like the way my street sign looks or something, but the minute that someone hits a pothole or even the timing on the traffic lights, which I've called George Delaney on plenty of times. So it's one of those divisions where we just hear from people when things are not, when the trains aren't running on time. So I just want to say that I appreciate with all my heart, all of the work that Linda Cornejo and the whole staff do every day and that I am always thankful when everything is running smoothly and people are happy. So when people are happy, we won't hear from them. And so this is one night where we're able to celebrate and be able to tell you, thank you. Thank you, Councilman Montero. Councilman Lopez. Thank you. I just wanted to say a quick thank you to all of you who are being honored, but also I think it's just a reflection of the department. It's a reflection of the leadership. When you look at basic city services and what our constituents see as city services, you are that face and that department accounts for so much of our budget and rightfully so, especially in a state where it snows one day, then it rains the hour later and then it's sunny, right? It wreaks havoc on our infrastructure and it wreaks havoc on our budget as well too. It wreaks havoc in offices. There's always a phone call that comes in from Council offices to Public Works Inc. and you fix this pothole, that pothole, and you get people out here. It doesn't just happen in a vacuum. These are hard working people. A lot of them who I know call Council District 3 home and it's their city and there's nothing more gratifying than when you go out there and you see folks, for example, with streets and et cetera out there putting in new asphalt, blistering summer days. It's over 200 degrees with the asphalt, with that heat coming out. And to see them being able to work on streets that they grew up in really says something and it says something about the quality of work that's being done, the dedication of our employees to our city. So, you know, I wish we can pass out, I don't know how many employees do we have, manager, Coordinator in Public Works. We should name all of them one day on a proclamation and not necessarily read it, but list it. It'd be interesting, but they all deserve it. And thank you very much, those of you who are being honored. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Rob. Thank you, Mr. President. I just can't list this resolution, go by noting that it honors two people from right away services, which is probably the part of Public Works that my office calls most frequently, whether it has to do with street occupancy permits in construction zones or closed sidewalks or parking. We talked to right away services almost on a daily basis. So, I wanted to call out that division, all of you are very deserving. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman Rob. In other comments, 320. Seeing none, Madam Secretary roll call. Shepherd. Aye. Sussman. Aye. Brooks. Aye. Faughts. Aye. Layman. Aye. Lopez. Aye. Montero. Aye. Nevett. Aye. Ortega. Aye. Rob. Aye. Mr. President. Aye. Madam Secretary, please close the voting, announce the results. 11 ayes. 11 ayes. Proclamation 320 has been adopted. Councilman Shepherd, is there someone you'd like to invite to the podium to receive the proclamation? The employees tonight as well. Thank you very much. Thank you for your proclamation, but more important for the relationship that members of the Council have developed with public works. I think this is very, very important that we have this type of relationship in order to not only maintain the city, but continuing building the city the way we're doing. Yes, I wish that all 11 hundred employees could be here today because each one of them really deserve by on the back for what they do. But we have our spotlight employees. We have the 10 employees that has been nominated as employee of the year, and I'd like to talk a little bit about each one of them because I think sometimes we get lost a little bit on when we have 11 hundred employees not talking about each one of them and what they do on a day-to-day basis. So I'd like to start with Rudy Schloaf from finance and administration. Rudy always goes above and beyond his duty. He engages in new training and new development

opportunities. He was selected to participate in the emerging leaders program and willingly accept the more responsibilities and challenges within the agency. Duane Thiehl's from Free Management. Duane is one of Fleet's exceptional supervisors who is passionate about his employees, his customers need an agency priorities. Sarah Anderson from Policy Planning and Sustainability. Sarah has exemplified leadership in the area of water quality planning and innovation by moving plans and projects forward even when policy barriers were present. Duane Lopez from Waste Water Operation. Duane has consistently been the highest production earner in his section, his experience in rating the condition of the city's sewer provides us and everybody that is making decisions with the right and exact information for future planning and design solutions. Larry Lovato from Street Maintenance. As a semi-driver, Larry plays a large role in helping Street maintenance achieve its annual goals including paving an additional 75 lane miles each year with money from the two-way initiative. Rosalia Villalobos from Solid Waste Management. Rosalia serves as the backbone of Solid Waste Management. He coordinates and manages traffic control which at times can be a challenging and difficult task that he handles with efficiency. Michael Lopez from Capital Project Management. Mike has been a key member of the Capital Project Management team specifically working with the bridge group. He has been instrumental in developing a new bridge maintenance program using inspection findings to tackle necessary maintenance and repair work. Stephen Forvili right from right away services. Steve is always trying to find ways to make Denver a better city. As a senior engineer, he contributes his wealth of experience in water quality, surveying and transportation engineering to improve the quality of capital projects. And last but not least is Rachel Branson from Transportation, Rachel Spashon for Transportation quickly to hear from intern to planner Denver Public Works. Her dedication seems from the impact transportation has on people every day live. Rachel strives to improve the quality of life in Denver. She petals thousands of miles each year on her own bike. Thank you very much for being here. Rachel, Rachel Reyes. Yes, and there is one more. Rachel Reyes Walsh from Right Away Enforcement and Permit. Rachel has provided years of critical administrative support within Right Away Enforcement and Permit Operations in here eight years with the city, here areas of responsibilities have grown to include the Electronic Parking Permits Program acting as a liaison from the parking magistrates to help with quality control for parking citation and supplying staff with uniform and operational items. Thank you very much. And if you all wouldn't mind standing. applause Get your people to stand up man. And there we go. Congratulations. All right, one more proclamation, 359, Councilman Lopez, will you please read proclamation 359. Thank you, Mr. President, proclamation 359, series of 2015, recognizing May 19th as Hepatitis Testing Day in July 28th as World Hepatitis Day, whereas May 19th is National Hepatitis Testing Day and July 28th is World Hepatitis Testing Day. Hepatitis C is recognized as the most common blood-borne viral infection in the United States, and whereas Hepatitis C has infected an estimated 70,000 Coloradans and as many as four million American residents, nearly one in 50 persons and more than 130 people, I'm sorry, 130 million people worldwide, and whereas it is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the number one reason for liver transplants in the United States, and whereas more Americans die of Hepatitis C than from HIV, making Hepatitis C one of the top preventable causes of death in the United States, and whereas as many as 17,000 Hepatitis C-related deaths occur annually in the United States, these rates are expected to peak between the years 2030 and 2035 at 36,000 deaths per year, and whereas people born between 1945 and 1965 are five times more likely to be infected than any other adults, more than 75% of all people with Hepatitis C and the United States are people in this age range, and many remain unaware of their status because they have not been tested for the virus, and whereas the incidence of Hepatitis C disproportionately affects people of color, and whereas 75% of infected persons do not show any signs or symptoms leading to the Hepatitis C virus to cause poor health outcomes and be labeled as quote unquote, the silent epidemic. And whereas the majority of individuals living with Hepatitis C infection can be cured of the virus through the advent of effective treatment options currently available on the market, and those cured through the treatment are able to stop and even reverse damage to the liver caused by the virus, and whereas Hepatitis C treatment costs are less than one fifth the cost of

liver transplants, and whereas Hepatitis C can be prevented, testing can identify existing infections and early diagnosis and treatment can save lives, money and resources, and whereas Hep C connection is available as a statewide resource for education, testing, linkage to care and other support services. Now therefore be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver. Section one, the Denver City Council agrees that preventing and treating Hepatitis C is an important public health initiative that will improve the quality of life or Denver residents affected by the virus. Section two, the Denver City Council proclaims May 19th as Hepatitis testing day and recognizes July 28th and has world Hepatitis day. And section three, at the clerk of the City and County of Denver shall test and affix a seal of the City and County of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to Nancy Stein for Executive Director of the Hep C connection. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, your motion to adopt. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that Council proclamation number 359, series of 2015 be adopted. It has been moved and seconded. Comments, Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. I have the honor and the pride to be able to pass this proclamation, introduce this proclamation and hopefully pass it, it will. Every year with the hopes that we can get the word out there to educate people about this virus. Now it is true, a lot of folks that were from 1945, 1965 and contracted it. I use this example because my grandfather, who served in World War II, was injured and because of his injuries received a blood transfusion and because they did not test or screen for this then and were generally unaware of it, he contracted it and the reason why he is not here today and died early is because of cirrhosis of the liver that was caused by that blood transfusion, by hepatitis C and had, we had known about it a long time ago, he'd probably still be here. There are a lot of people who are unaware of their infection. There was a lot of people who have a lot of myths about Hep C. It is preventable. We do have treatment for it. We just have to make sure that the word gets out and that we treat it like any other disease where we have to know as much as we can about it and keep folks aware of it and not humanize the folks that have it but help them. This is something that is the silent epidemic and it is preventable. And Mr. President, it plays with my emotions a little bit to read this proclamation because I totally wish that we could have done this a long, long time ago and that these kind of proclamations are read in council a long, long time ago. So I'm very honored to read this. I'm very honored to participate in the organization and your activities. And I ask my college colleagues to join me in supporting this proclamation and moving this forward. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega. That was not on this bill, sorry. Oh, okay. I apologize. Any other comments? Proclamation 359. Okay. Seeing none, Madam Secretary, roll call. Lopez. Aye. Seeing none, Madam Secretary, roll call. Lopez. Aye. Montero. Aye. Nevett. Aye. Ortega. Aye. Rob. Aye. Shepard. Aye. Sussman. Aye. Brooks. Aye. Fots. Layman. Aye. Ms. President. Aye. Madam Secretary, please close the vote. Announce the results. Ten ayes. Ten ayes. Proclamation 359 has been adopted. I'd like to invite to a podium to receive the proclamation. Yeah, Mr. President, I'd like to invite the Executive Director of the HEPC connection. Ms. Nancy Steinforth, if you want to come up. And introduce your partner. Thank you all very much. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you once again about this resolution. It's a really important public health issue. And I am honored that the Denver City Council has chosen to support this for many years now. In the 2014 health of Denver report created by the office environmental of environmental health, it lists chronic liver disease as the seventh top leading cause of death in Denver. And chronic liver disease as the fifth leading cause of premature death in Denver. Hepatitis C figures prominently in these rankings, but it doesn't have to. We encourage baby boomers and those with risk factors to get tested for free tomorrow in the web building from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. There is a cure, but only if you know you have the disease. So we strongly encourage everyone to get tested. Tomorrow, there's no sign up. You just walk in. It takes 20 minutes. It's a

little finger stick. It takes 20 minutes to get the results, I should say. The finger stick, 20 minutes, good to go. So I would now like to introduce Dr. Sarah Rowan, who is from Denver Health. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, City Council, for allowing me to speak about Hepatitis C. I run a testing program and I treat patients who have Hepatitis C. Hep C affects people of all ages, not just baby boomers. People who are pregnant can transmit Hep C to their babies. It affects young adults. It affects people in middle age and 40s, 50s. And it affects the baby boomer cohort that was born 1945 to 1965. Unfortunately, for the past, for the first time in the past 30 years, we're seeing an increase in new infections from Hep C. There was a huge amount of transmission in the 70s and 80s. And then the incidence went down. And as I said for the first time in 30 years, the incidence is increasing again. Our current data suggested in Colorado, the incidence is stable. But our data is based on surveillance from 2012 and 2013. That's the most up to date numbers that we have statewide about Hepatitis C. In neighboring states, including especially the ones in central Appalachia or Appalachia, depending where you're from, they've seen a 364% increase in Hepatitis C among people under age 30 from 2006 to 2012. In fact, 30 states around the country have seen an increase in Hepatitis C in that same time period. The CDC reports that in those Appalachian states, which are Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, they've seen a concurrent increase in admissions for treatment for opiate abuse and specifically injection drug abuse. The link between opiate abuse, injection drug abuse, and Hepatitis C is very clear. This has been well documented in Colorado. As you all know, we have an increase in prescription drug opiate abuse in Colorado. And similarly, we have an increase in heroin use in both urban and non-urban areas in Colorado. In fact, from 2012 to 2013, there was a 27% increase in heroin use among people ages 18 to 24. We hope that harm reduction measures like needle exchange and increased testing that have been implemented to prevent HIV transmission will stem what seems like an inevitable increase in Hepatitis C among young people. However, as treatment is not widely available for Hepatitis C, the increase in Hepatitis C that is coming to Colorado seems unfortunately inevitable. The second large population that's affected by Hep C is the baby boomers. In Colorado, specifically in the Denver Metro, we have an increase in liver-related cancers, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver-related death. Many people were infected before Hepatitis C was even discovered, and the blood supply wasn't tested until 1992. So now, as the people who were infected in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s are approaching 30 years of infection, they're developing complications of Hepatitis C. It's a very indolent virus, but when it develops into cirrhosis, the risk for decompensation and liver disease-related death increases significantly. Our estimates from the state level suggest maybe 3,000, maybe 7,000 cases of Hepatitis C. However, estimates from local data from Adams, Rapahoe, and Denver counties suggest we may have 20,000 cases in just those three counties. Therefore, the cost, the morbidity, and the mortality from Hepatitis C will be increasing in the coming years. The majority of patients have Medicaid, so there will be an increased public burden of the cost of these treatments, or lack of treatments. Testing for Hepatitis C is the most important way to start the treatment process and to stem the growing morbidity and mortality. As I've mentioned to you the past two years, we've been doing a community testing initiative at Denver Health, where we test in all of our community health clinics. We found that of 3,000 baby boomers tested, who had never been tested for Hep C before, 9% have Hep C, so these are folks who never knew they had Hep C. Of the African American men tested, 16% have Hepatitis C. This is an incredible disparity in our community that needs to be addressed, and also speaks to this increase in morbidity and mortality that we will be seeing. That concludes my comments, and I'll be happy to take any questions, and thank you again for letting me speak. Thank you. I don't believe we have any questions. Thank you all for that. Thank you, Councilman Lopez for bringing that forward again. All right, those are two proclamations. We were ready for the resolution. Madam Secretary, please read the resolution.

Then we have 268, called out by Council members, FOTS and SUSMAN. All right, so we got 4, 121, called out by Councilwoman Shepherd, 217, Councilwoman Artega. Bills for introduction. Bills for final, 257, Councilwoman Artega, 268, Council members, FOTS and SUSMAN. And I'll quickly check pending, nothing called out. All right, Madam Secretary, you want to tee up the first one, 121, called out by Councilwoman Shepherd. We'll wait for the screens to catch up. But Councilwoman, what would you like for us to do with this? I just have a question, please. I'll go right ahead. Okay, I think this is probably for Nancy Kuhn. So this is about our contract with waste management curbside for door-to-door collection of household hazardous waste, such as oil pesticides and batteries. And I know this is not a new program, but I was thinking we should just take a quick moment to help let folks know how they would access this program. So the household, again, Nancy Kuhn, Denver Public Works. The household hazardous waste program has been in service since 1999. Denver Public Works has been providing that service. We advertise through our annual waste-wise mailer that goes through to all homes in the city and also through our storm water bills. We have an insert that advertises it. It's also on our website. So on the Denver Global website, you can find a link to this. And basically what you do is you make a call and they explain to you how to sort of package up your household hazardous waste for pickup. So there's instructions, and I believe there might be a copay. But it's sort of like if you imagine like going into

your garage or your shed or looking under your kitchen sink and the types of things that you might have under there say, pesticides that you hadn't used all of them of, or maybe a wood thinner or a paint product or something like that, or maybe some old cleaners that you don't want to throw in the landfill. So the idea is that we have a collection system that you can use and so you don't throw that stuff in the landfill. So easiest way to find it is on our website. There's instructions there and phone numbers to call and instructions and they'll get you set up. Okay. Thank you. Don't throw that bad stuff away. That's right. Thank you, Councilwoman Shepherd. All right, ma'am secretary, let's see up the next one. It should be 217, caught up by Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Ortega, what would you like for us to do with this? I have a question. Go right ahead. If someone is here that can address my question, I would appreciate it. This is for AECOM technical services. It's for professional architect and engineering design services for the 38th and Blake transit station for the 35th, 36th pedestrian bridge. So I'm just curious to know what changed in the scope of work that added $177,662 to the project. Is there someone that can answer that question for me? Nancy? I tried reaching out to the project manager before the meeting. I'm sorry I wasn't able to get the details on this, but I can definitely clarify for you and send you an email in the morning. Okay. I would appreciate it. Thank you. I'll let it go forward on first reading, but I would like to get that information. I'll send it to everyone. I appreciate it. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. I'm Secretary of the next one. It should be billed under final 257. Councilwoman Ortega, what would you like for us to do with this? Also question. It's related to 258, 259, and 260, although I'm just pulling out one of them. So I'm trying to understand what the total amount is for the 61st Avenue Painable of our transit station. When I add up the numbers from the first two bills, it looks like it's $38,139,192. But then Council Bill 260 speaks to $35 million, and so I'm trying to understand what the total cost is on this project. It looks like the city via DIA is up fronting $17 million. Is that accurate? At least that's what Council Bill 260 is saying. So Stewart, are you the point guy or Dan? Would you mind coming forward and answering my questions? Council President and Council members, I'm Dan Paremba. I'm the Senior Vice President of Development at DIA. And to answer the specific question on cost, the total cost for phase one of the Painio Station TOD project is $58.7 million. And DIA is contributing $38.14 million. The neighbors are contributing about $20.5 million. The neighbors, meaning you said the neighbors are contributing. You may remember that at this 400 acre TOD project, in addition to DIA's 60 acres, there's actually three other landowners. The Fulenwider Company, LC Fulenwider owns about 150 acres. They are the lead developer. Ferd Bell is here tonight representing Fulenwider. There's also the Smith Estate, which owns an additional 150 acres, and there's a smaller piece, the SMT parcel that's about 20 acres. There's also about 38 acres of open space. So these four owners have come together and processed this TOD transportation oriented development plan over the last several years with a number of related agreements through Council. And have worked out now over the last couple of years this plan of finance and development for the phase one infrastructure as well as the pinionable of our East Line Station at this location. And the connecting infrastructure and station together totaled a 58.7 million of which DIA is contributing $38.14 million up front. Two things to remember. One is that DIA is projected to be completely repaid for that investment through Metro District levies that are assessed on the neighbors property that I mentioned. And over 40 years it's projected that we will be returned about $41 million, actually $42 million in total reimbursement. The other thing that's really important to remember is that this opens up for DIA, a consistent and rather large non-airline revenue stream that totals we're projecting somewhere between 100. Let me just check my figures on that. Between 132 and $194 million over a 40 year period. So we're actually projecting that the DIA investment of 38.1 million is repaid within a period of about 15 years. So to answer your part of your question which was within the financing concepts, the reimbursement that

comes through the Metro District repayments on the neighbors property. We actually, those are tied to specific interest rates against specific dollar amounts that are just portions of the total investment. That was really done for financing purposes, but those two reimbursement amounts are 35.6 million and 6 million and those total, the 41.6 million that's being reimbursed to DIA over time through these mill levy reimbursement mechanisms. Dan, can you just clarify, you spoke to this being the first phase, so what entails any additional phases that will include additional costs to the city, whether it's from DIA or somewhere else within the city. The phase one infrastructure as well as the station costs are the lion's share or the great majority of the total development costs for this TOD. But there are some future phases that pertain to the installation primarily of streets that go into expanding the development sites at DIA's projected future phase investments are in the range of about $6 million today. Which is the 6 million you just talked about. It's not directly tied to that, but we're projecting a future contribution required from DIA of $6 million and that's generally related to installation of street costs. And again, that's strictly DIA costs, not city of Denver general fund. Okay, so the total cost then, is it 58.7? That is strictly for the phase one of this project, which as I mentioned is the lion's share of the infrastructure. There will be minor costs, additional costs over time, but we anticipate that those will be a number of years into the future. Thank you, Dan. I appreciate you explaining all of that. I know you came to committee and sometimes the way the details are presented don't always give that full picture, so I needed to understand that as we're looking at all of these different bills before us tonight. So I appreciate you. You're welcome. This is a complicated package with five agreements and we're working on the closing today and we figured we can it up that they're actually 50 to 60 separate agreements and supporting documents that actually will be needed to support the final closing. If you could just clarify one last thing. This is where Panasonic will be as well, correct? Yes, and these are the infrastructure costs that are necessary to make their site developable, and they will actually be breaking ground on their site projected in October of this year. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Thank you, Councilor Tega. All right. We have one more, I believe, Madam Secretary. You want to tee that one up? 268, caught up by Council members, FOTS and Sesame. Let me first go to Councilman FOTS. What did you want for us to do with that? I have some questions, please. Okay. And let me see Councilman Brooks has chimed into Councilman Sesame. Did you have questions or do you want to call out for a vote? What did you want to do? I have some questions as well. Councilman, all questions. All right. We'll start the top. Councilwoman FOTS. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, the title of this ordinance concerns the sale of tobacco products. So that's the topic that we're talking about. And in safety committee, we went down. We heard testimony down one road about licensure. This is not a licensure bill. As I understand it was supposed to be conforming some of the definitions to state law. And so my first question is, is that the case? How does this fit with state law? The second question, I received a letter of concern from a constituent in Harvey Park. And I wanted to be sure that a couple of these questions were asked. She was concerned about having a ban on outdoor or public use of tobacco products. I want to make sure it does not do that except in certain circumstances. And the last thing is she was very concerned about, since you can't give away tobacco products, having the vape and the electronic cigarettes, she was very concerned about that stopping the ability to sample the taste of some of these. And I am just wondering if you can't give it away, can you charge a penny or a nickel fee on each? I mean, this is a legal question, but I would like to know, is there a way around that? And who is the lawyer who drafted it? Good evening, Jessica Brody, Assistant City Attorney for the Denver City Attorney's Office, and I will do my best to answer your questions. So with respect to your first question, the definition in state law, there are a couple of provisions in the Colorado revised statutes that define tobacco

products, and in particular, in Title 24, which concerns the regulation of tobacco sales to minors, there is a definition in 24-35-502, which refers you back to Title 18-13-121, which defines cigarette tobacco product or nicotine product as follows. A product that contains nicotine or tobacco or is derived from tobacco and is intended to be ingested or inhaled by or applied to the skin of an individual, or any device that can be used to deliver tobacco or nicotine to the person inhaling from the device, including an electronic cigarette, cigar, cigarette, or pipe. So to clarify, the specific words in our code are a little bit different from the specific words in the state statute, but I think the intent is to broadly define tobacco and nicotine products to cover the universe of products that are available in the marketplace today. Addressing your second question about outdoor use, nothing in the bill today changes or restricts outdoor use of products, so it's not going to make any change with respect to that specific issue. With regard to sampling, we have an existing provision, and this is in Chapter 24 of the revised municipal code. This is the language that would be amended by this bill. The existing provision already prohibits sampling of tobacco products, but again, what we're doing tonight is essentially updating the definition of tobacco products. The original version of this law was enacted in 1998. A lot of products have come to market since then, which were not contemplated back in 1998. So the intent is to update the definition to include all of this products and treat the products in a similar manner. Just as a follow up on the latter one then, I'm not exactly sure from what the sampling is done since I am not a smoker at this point. So I have not partaken of any of this, but can a person have a method to at least sell a puff of something? I don't believe that would be prohibited by the legislation if it's amended tonight. You do not believe it would be prohibited. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Councilman Fots. Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you for those questions, Councilman Fots. I have some similar ones. You read the state ordinance that we are the state rule that we are trying to emulate, but you didn't read how ours was different from it. What were the characteristics that ours are different from what the state says? What are we fixing in this city? Well, again, there are sort of two components to the bill before you tonight. One is an update of the definition of tobacco products, which we just talked about. The other piece of it is to remove some restrictions on advertising of tobacco products at retail. Similar provisions have been struck down by the Supreme Court in the Laurel RV Riley decision. So the intent of tonight's legislation is to address those two issues. The state does not have a sampling prohibition akin to the city's sampling prohibition. And thank you. And my next question is, does our proposed ordinance prohibit the sampling of a product that has no nicotine in it? I don't believe it would. Okay. You don't believe it would? Well, again, I would refer you back to the definition of tobacco products as its proposed means any product containing tobacco or nicotine or that is made or derived from tobacco. So if there's no nicotine or no tobacco, I don't believe it would be included in that definition. And we don't allow sampling of cigarettes, right? Correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Sussman. Councilman Lopez, Councilman Brooks, deferred to you. Actually, go ahead, Councilman. Well, I was going to, maybe in your remarks, you're going to answer my question, but I wanted to talk a little bit about the outreach that you did in lieu of this bill coming up. No, absolutely. Thank you, Councilman. If I may, Council President. Go ahead. And I do appreciate the questions in no way. Is this a ban of any kind of outdoor use or public use? What we wanted to do is when we were looking at, originally, what we sat to do, and this is a lot of folks actually in our city, especially a lot of the youngsters that came and have been working on this for a few years. Let me just start out with the problem. We have found, and we, with Denver Health, and also with a lot of the youth that are working on this license to sell tobacco products, that we are seeing more access for young people. And this all started with young people. In no way, this isn't an attack on the folks who sell vape.

What we want to prohibit is what's going on now, and this is something that's recently been released by the CDC. Is that more than a quarter of a million young people, middle school and high school students, who have never smoked a regular cigarette, had smoked an electronic cigarette. Now, this is something that does carry nicotine, and that's three times the increase in usage among teens from 2013 to 14. In the same breath, a group of students that were working, were working over a couple years, had gone in on their own as part of this project, as part of the study, and found that anytime they go into some of these shops, cigarettes, but these were non-cigarette tobacco products. And they asked to sample them, and they asked to get a hold of them, 60% of the time they were successful. And so we want to be able to address that. That is an issue. Yes, tobacco use is a preventable issue, and it is a death from tobacco products is preventable. We want to make sure that this bill, we originally looked at this as licensing. In looking at licensing, we realized that we were behind. We're behind the times in our own ordinances. And so in doing that, we realized that one, we can preempt federal law in the Supreme Court decision, so we wanted to eradicate that language. But two, to add, to update the universe. Because since 1998, there's been a lot of new products out there. We're looking at Cegarrios, dissolvables, electronic cigarettes, who could tobacco? Not listed in there. And so we want to do is update it because, you know, nine times out of 10, you go into a shop, a lot of folks know what they're doing. They're not selling to anybody under 18. But there are some bad actors out there. And we want to make sure that we are going after those bad actors because it's not right. A minor is being given these products, right? And we want to protect that. So, you know, I was unaware of the email until today. And, you know, not to say that it doesn't count or it doesn't matter. But we did have a public hearing committee. We discussed this. We invited a lot of folks to the table. We outreached with the business community, the retail association, a lot of those folks. You know, at the end of the day, they were okay with actually updating our language. It's the licensing sheen that generated a lot of the harbor. And so, you know, the result of it is we're working on it with the task force of Denver Health. And we're going to look at it closer and see what we can do to prevent the usage among youngsters with some of these products. But also to make sure that we are doing our best in the city to understand who is selling these products. Update that database because it is defunct. It is disorganized. And also to make sure that, at least from our end, our enforcement is up to par. And I think that's something that we discussed in that process. So, like I said, the intent is to clean up the bill. And the intent is to clean up the universe and make sure that we're in stride with regulations. So. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Brooks. Yeah. So, I received just an email and, you know, this bill is on second reading. And I say this all the time when we're discussing bills, you know, please don't come at the last minute. But we did receive this email today and then I received a couple messages as well. And it was enough for me to bring it up to you, Councilman, and to, you know, whoever you were working with with staff. But the issue is the vamping stores are feeling like if they don't get a chance to, you know, we're hurting our whole industry, right? If they don't get a chance to sample in there. And so, I just wanted to make sure they were able to reach out to you that you had a conversation with some of those folks. And if so, who were those individuals? And just sort of record. If I can respond, you know, I didn't, with all due respect, I had no idea your association even existed until two o'clock today. And I just figured out, okay, well, I guess there was a blog announcement that sent out. But there's something I had no idea, had we known, we've been invited to the table. The intent isn't to hurt the shops itself, baby. It's to tighten up our laws to make sure that we are

were up to date. It's this chapter 24 2.0. You want to make sure that we're up to date. And that we are mindful of what products are out there. And we want to make sure that they're out of the hands of miners. Now, is this something that would prevent your business from succeeding? Is this something that will prevent you from sampling? Absolutely not. Charge a penny, charge a nickel, whatever it takes. You know, I can't go into a cigarette store and say, can I sample a cigarette? I can't. I can't do that with a lot of products. That's something that, you know, this will be worked out, but that's not the intent. The intent is to keep it out of hands of miners to update our laws. You can still sample, just might want to do charge a penny, charge a nickel. Councilor Brooks, do you have any other? No, not right now. Thank you. Councilor Murat, you're up. I'm sorry, I had rung in and then wasn't sure that I needed to weigh in on it. But I do want to say that I've watched the work that Councilman Lopez has done on this. There were a group of students in front of Council a couple years ago. And once I did to receive the emails today, and once I read through the bill and realized these are fairly minor changes that do bring it up to date, I am in support of the ordinance. Nice. My screen just went out. So I have to look up to you if there anybody else? Councilman Lopez, go ahead. You know, with all due faith and respect, you know, I do want to be able to have a conversation with folks just because you're not out at the podium and weren't able to come to committee. It doesn't mean that the opinion doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I would have, knowing that there is some kind of organization, I would like to have that discussion. But do I want to held up the bill that something I've worked on worked a long time on and put a lot of effort in? No, but I would love to understand, you know, the industry, everything else and see how you move forward from there. But at this point forward, you know, at the final reading, I'd like to see it pass on final reading. But like I said, no disrespect intended. All right. Any other comments on 268? All right. Well, Madam Secretary, I believe that is all the bills we had called out. So we are ready for the block votes. All of the bills for introduction are ordered published. Councilman Sesame, will you please put the resolutions on the floor for adoption? Yes, Mr. President. I move that resolutions all of series 15, 266, 269, 270, 273. Hmm. Be adopted in a block.

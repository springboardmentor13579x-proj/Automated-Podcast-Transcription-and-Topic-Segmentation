 Welcome to the Moth, I'm Suzanne Rust. A few days ago we shared a Moth radio hour all about shoes, but on this episode we're going to be talking about a different type of soul. Yes, we're going from the soul of your shoe to the soul inside you, with stories about connections, bonds, being there for the people we love, and all the things that make you you. First up, we have Heather McGee. She told this as Chicago Story Slam, where the theme of the night was baggage. Here's Heather, live come off. So when I was a teenager, I had so much social anxiety, like crippling. I was from a really big family with a million brothers and sisters, so you might be surprised to see that as a characteristic of me. So we were a fundamentalist. I was homeschooled. We were very isolated. I lived out with the cows, you form fields. Now my mom was a real teacher. She actually gave me a great education being homeschooled. However, she also knew I wanted to go to college. And to go to college, we had a million kids. You don't have a lot of money. I needed scholarships. And if I was going to get a scholarship, I needed to go to a traditional school. So when I turned 14, my mom enrolled me in a regular high school. This was terrifying to me. Going to the lunchroom and figuring out where to sit was the most horrifying thing to me every day. I spent the entirety of my high school experience being scared to be seen or occurred or have to interact with anyone, while getting a nae plus and every class. So anyway, when we got to my senior year, I found out we were taking a senior trip to Spain for 10 days. And to someone who had only been to the Super Walmart in my tiny town, this was both thrilling, really overwhelming. I also didn't have a suitcase. And I didn't know how it was going to get that suitcase. We didn't have the money to get a suitcase. So I was really worried about this. And I brought it up to my granny. Now my granny was not a part of our fundamentalist religious community. She was the opposite. She wore Betty Boop sweatshirts. She wore Cheetah prints. She wore a T-shirt that said, I'm sexy. And she was in her 70s. So anyway, I was really worried about this. And I explained my situation to my granny. She was like, oh, I've got a suitcase. You can just take mine. She pulled it out of a closet and I about died. Because what she showed me as an incredibly shy person who's about to go on first big trip, first trip of a light with a bunch of classmates who I desperately wanted to impress. She pulled out the loudest, hugeest pink tie-dye hard-sized suitcase that anyone has ever seen in their life. And it wasn't just pink on the outside. It was pink on the inside with a lovely shade of Pepto Bismol. And it was also loud in an actual way. There were some clips on it that when you locked it and you had to punch it to make it close, made the loudest noise you have also ever heard in your life. I was mortified, but I was also too shy to turn my granny down and I needed a suitcase. So I took it. My entire mission in life at that time was to blend in with the wallpaper. And I knew me and that bright pink suitcase were going to Spain whether I liked it or not and I would be seen in her. Also whether I liked it or not. So I showed up at the airport when I big pink suitcase relegated to my fate. I channeled the power of my granny's. I loved that most trusty across the floor to the ticket counter. God on that plane got myself to Spain. We were going to a few different places so I opened it, closed it. Those clips got louder with every time I opened and closed it. And I was shocked on that trip. Because it turns out my classmates thought my suitcase was cool. They liked the color because it stood out. They thought that clicky loud locks were hilarious. And you know as we were going from place to place I think I started to take on the power of that suitcase. Because I started to feel proud. Nobody else had a suitcase like this. Their suitcases were black, they were brown, they were gray, their locks would quiet. You know and I just really took that in and I started thinking about what this pink suitcase actually meant. You know my granny lived her life at 100%. She had so many friends. She went on big trips. She was a kind of person that bought a crazy pink suitcase. She was in a choir. She told me how to dance in her living room. She lived life to the fullest at every moment at every second. But it hadn't always been like that. When she was 18 she married my grandpa. My grandpa seemed to be seated to spend the entire of his life trying to kill her. He put her head in the oven more than once, centered to the hospital more than once. I think the day that my grandpa died is the day that her life really started. When I got back from Spain, I was standing at the airport waiting for my baggage to leave for my bag. That total ugly suitcase came out of the suit. But this one when it came around the carousel. Instead of being embarrassed, I picked it up proudly. And now when I think about it, I see it as I think about it as more than just a pink suitcase. It was the lesson that my granny taught me that I pull into my own rice about how don't let the bad things in life. Maybe from being your wildest, boldest, keep it self. That was Heather McGee. Heather is an Emmy and Camp Lion award-winning founder and host of the Happily Never After Podcast, which takes a look at how life's endings can lead to a new beginning. She is currently working on her debut memoir about growing up in a Fundamentals Christian sect. She asked Heather, if, looking back, she had any more thoughts about her grandmother and getting to see her in a new light. She told us that her granny went through so much in her life, courtesy of the domestic violence suffered at the hands of her husband. Heather's grateful that after her grandpa died, she was old enough to bear witness to her grandmother's resurrection and blooming into the life she always wanted. She taught Heather a lot about resilience and how the worst thing that happens to you doesn't have to define you. It's the break. Another soulful story. Be back in a moment.

Ashley McElvy told this at Atlanta Story Slam where the theme of the night was big breaks. Here's Ashley, live with them all. Eric and I had been together almost 10 years when we got engaged. We had lived in three different houses and two different states and we would have a loathe but my brother had a loathe. When I got engaged, my dad said, you guys can do whatever you want about a ceremony, but your mom and I would like to be there to kind of like to see where my kids get married. I was like, Jesus Christ, that's obviously we're going to play in a wedding, but I didn't play in a wedding. I just found it so overwhelming and I could not think about it at all. So Eric and I had been engaged for about three years when my parents drove out from Arkansas for a visit and to tell me that my mom might be dying. She had had cancer before and she goes in regularly for scans and checkups. They'd see something on the scans that had been can be certain. And now my parents were sitting in my kitchen saying that October would be a really good time for Eric and I had to get married. It'd be really great if we could get married in October and it was mid September. And so as soon as they left town, I just started to paint Google like small wedding, tiny wedding and this phrase popped up and it was micro weddings and I was like, that's what I want a micro wedding. And so I called a friend of mine and I was talking to her about it. I said, you know, here's the thing, no matter how small the wedding is, there's just like all these decisions that need to get made. And I'm a little bit of a control freak and I feel like there are decisions that need to be made. I need to make them. And on the other hand, I don't care about any of this. I'm just going to get done. And she said, do you really not care? And I said, I really don't. I said, if it is a good, nice time and a lovely wedding, that's great. And if it's a shit show, Eric and I will tell stories about that for the rest of our lives. So like, I'm good either way. And she said, I think you should make the fewest decisions possible. And I realized that was correct. And there's this place called Speak Russ Weddings and they will do as much as you ask them to do. They did everything but buy me a dress, basically. And I called them and I was talking to them about our situation and I really liked their vibe. And I said, be honest, like, can we even get married in October? And she said, well, do you want to get married in a barn or a barn or a historical building? And I was like, oh, historical building please. And she said, yeah, you can get married October 24. And I just let's do it. And I sent her a check and I wrote some deposits. And we emailed out wedding invitations. We did not have time to wait for the VISTA service. And everything was happening. All of a sudden some people were starting to RSVP and they were buying plane tickets. And my mom called and she said, I have some good news. She said they did a different kind of scan. And it looks like I don't think that my mom is a liar. I think you guys think that but she's not, I don't think my mom's a liar. And she said they think it's going to be a scar tissue and they think that I'm going to be okay. And I'm so happy. And I was so relieved. And then I just said, I just played a wedding six weeks. And she said, I know, I feel so terrible. I feel so bad that we rushed you into doing this so quickly. And I almost didn't even know if I should tell you. And I was like, oh my God. You're like, always tell me when you're not dying. Like I always have time for it. And I said, no, it's fun. Eric and I are going to get married and you're going to be okay and it's great. And it's going to be great. And on October 24th I went to the venue and I was going to see my wedding for the first time. And I started to get a little nervous because I don't really like weddings or ceremonies or things that involve a lot of fuss. But I also know that like planning a big event and celebrating a thing and like flushing over details is like how you show that things matter. And now that I know my mom's going to be okay, like I'm starting to realize how much this will in matters to me. And I walked in and it was perfect. It was vibrant and colorful and lively and a little weird and a little irreverent. It was just great. And after the wedding people kept saying like, oh my god, it just felt so much like you and Eric, which was exactly what I wanted. And I could not have planned anything half that good. And my parents there, my mom was there. And Eric's parents were there. And my 90 year old grandmother was there and our 10 year old nephew was there. And it was a great day and I could have never planned it. But I could make it happen once I had the right motivation. That was Ashley McElfy. Ashley has always loved a good story. She lives in Atlanta where she has performed at the Moth and Story Collider. She and Eric recently celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary and her parents are happy and healthy in Arkansas.

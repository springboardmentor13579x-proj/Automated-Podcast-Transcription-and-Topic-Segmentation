0.00-17.28 :  So, we're going to discuss the living field design, the geological design, the environment
17.28-23.36 :  and the result of this meeting has to be a certain one, the details which we're going
23.36-30.60 :  to do, obviously, climate design. And then I'm going to have to specify the design in
30.60-37.44 :  the climate work. So, just from the last time to recap, so we're going to have a
37.44-44.40 :  smooth handshake with no LCD display, which is a top-side, which is taken in the kinetic
44.80-66.92 :  way. We're重 over ten times is not the one where we should have observations in us,
66.92-68.92 :  There you are.
68.92-70.92 :  Great.
70.92-72.92 :  Here you go.
72.92-74.92 :  I am going to do a little bit.
74.92-76.92 :  I am going to do a little bit.
76.92-78.92 :  I am going to do an extended,
78.92-80.92 :  and then,
80.92-82.92 :  extended, the color expenses,
82.92-84.92 :  the average amount of the color,
84.92-86.92 :  you know, instead,
86.92-88.92 :  you can see this,
88.92-90.92 :  and you start to vary by different,
90.92-92.92 :  based on the size,
92.92-94.92 :  the size,
94.92-96.92 :  the color,
96.92-98.92 :  and the button.
98.92-100.92 :  Often, I am just going to put something in the bottom.
100.92-102.92 :  And there isn't,
102.92-104.92 :  there isn't up and up to the bottom.
104.92-106.92 :  I think,
106.92-108.92 :  I think, I think, it's still hidden for you.
108.92-110.92 :  Right, there isn't.
110.92-112.92 :  Where are they?
112.92-114.92 :  They mean something to you, don't they?
114.92-116.92 :  So, what kind of thing is going to be?
116.92-118.92 :  I'll see you down on this display,
118.92-120.92 :  on community,
120.92-122.92 :  the name of our company.
122.92-124.92 :  Right,
124.92-126.92 :  new contents.
126.92-128.92 :  We'll just say,
128.92-130.92 :  it only has four colors,
130.92-132.92 :  very simple to you.
132.92-134.92 :  As many, the minimum amount,
134.92-136.92 :  you get,
136.92-138.92 :  it might even be one,
138.92-140.92 :  bit of a complex,
140.92-142.92 :  you can't,
142.92-144.92 :  picture,
144.92-146.92 :  simple to the,
146.92-148.92 :  and what is this here?
148.92-150.92 :  That's the number time.
150.92-152.92 :  Where are we going to have the change?
152.92-154.92 :  Um,
154.92-156.92 :  oh, along the, yeah.
156.92-158.92 :  The function.
158.92-160.92 :  You have this space here,
160.92-162.92 :  where the button is.
162.92-164.92 :  It's always usually quite small, right?
164.92-166.92 :  It's not quite huge,
166.92-168.92 :  so,
168.92-170.92 :  it's like,
170.92-172.92 :  let's say a bunch of other side,
172.92-174.92 :  so you still have quite a bit.
174.92-176.92 :  So, if this is a fiscal,
176.92-178.92 :  what kind of dimensions are you thinking?
178.92-180.92 :  What,
180.92-182.92 :  what,
182.92-184.92 :  what,
184.92-186.92 :  maybe the ones we've been in,
186.92-188.92 :  that would be the two sides.
188.92-190.92 :  Okay.
190.92-192.92 :  So, that would be about some of you,
192.92-194.92 :  but, but, you know,
194.92-196.92 :  one, two, three,
196.92-198.92 :  four,
198.92-200.92 :  three,
200.92-202.92 :  five,
202.92-204.92 :  nine, seven,
204.92-206.92 :  eight,
206.92-208.92 :  ten centimeters.
208.92-210.92 :  That would be good.
210.92-212.92 :  The ten centimeters times is the same.
212.92-214.92 :  And,
214.92-216.92 :  I'll be good. In fact,
216.92-218.92 :  ten is both ten centimeters usually.
218.92-220.92 :  There are the,
220.92-222.92 :  that's how we do it.
222.92-224.92 :  That's great. It's very bright.
224.92-226.92 :  So, um,
226.92-228.92 :  is it possible,
228.92-230.92 :  just going back to the idea of colors.
230.92-232.92 :  This needs, I need some colors,
232.92-234.92 :  and a production.
234.92-236.92 :  And, uh,
236.92-238.92 :  probably,
238.92-240.92 :  you know,
240.92-242.92 :  okay, so,
242.92-244.92 :  let's go on the picture that goes.
244.92-246.92 :  So,
246.92-248.92 :  um,
248.92-250.92 :  and,
250.92-252.92 :  and,
252.92-254.92 :  and,
254.92-256.92 :  and,
256.92-258.92 :  and,
258.92-260.92 :  and,
260.92-262.92 :  and,
262.92-264.92 :  about,
264.92-265.92 :  is there
265.92-267.92 :  colors?
267.92-268.92 :  Those're only emphasizes
268.92-270.92 :  in terms of audition.
270.92-272.92 :  Okay.
272.92-274.92 :  Okay. Deaf,就是 tewin.
274.92-276.92 :  Oh, we just ask,
276.92-279.96 :  i highly,
279.96-280.76 :  whyatter.
280.76-281.96 :  How high is it?
281.96-283.96 :  Not too high.
283.96-285.96 :  But,
285.96-287.96 :  Oh, oh, so deaf,
287.96-288.68 :  doesn't that...
288.68-290.92 :  It is pretty hard?
290.92-297.92 :  You can skip the channel and do it for me.
297.92-302.92 :  Well, it's not the way people do it.
302.92-310.92 :  Because you've got the RCD and don't have it, you start with them and you start with one.
310.92-314.92 :  And what else do you do for Joe's life?
314.92-318.92 :  It's more about something like contrast color.
318.92-322.92 :  Contrast? Brightness?
322.92-324.92 :  No.
324.92-327.92 :  It's whatever else we like doing things in the market.
327.92-330.92 :  And you don't have to do the things that's why they're...
330.92-333.92 :  Well, that's the design, but I like it.
333.92-335.92 :  Not going to be easy.
335.92-338.92 :  Do things like brightness contrast?
338.92-339.92 :  Uh-huh.
339.92-341.92 :  Do you choose the controls?
341.92-343.92 :  The K-chance.
344.92-347.92 :  You know, I'm the very input in the DCI.
347.92-349.92 :  You could be in that.
349.92-352.92 :  So, color is sharpness.
352.92-354.92 :  Yeah, color is sharpness.
354.92-359.92 :  A lot of these things will have to be three edges of the music with the green.
359.92-364.92 :  Okay, we've got a sun setting, and you change the music.
364.92-367.92 :  You have like your basic...
367.92-370.92 :  The bass, your midrange, your high range.
370.92-372.92 :  Yeah, bass and bounce.
372.92-373.92 :  Yeah.
373.92-375.92 :  That's right.
375.92-382.92 :  Maybe you have pre-programmed sound, like the user could pick any and choose a sound board.
382.92-385.92 :  But I think you could be...
385.92-388.92 :  You could pick up the building and sound.
388.92-389.92 :  Okay.
389.92-392.92 :  You don't know the boat and the...
392.92-394.92 :  That's fine.
394.92-396.92 :  Just need to know if you know it.
396.92-397.92 :  Okay.
398.92-400.92 :  Right.
400.92-402.92 :  I guess that's it.
402.92-405.92 :  So, we've not...
405.92-413.92 :  We've not had a little look at the excel sheet and price distance, the 32.
413.92-417.92 :  32, think, and so on.
417.92-421.92 :  So, for this first part here, color one.
421.92-422.92 :  You've actually...
422.92-424.92 :  Do you have kinetic as well?
424.92-425.92 :  No.
426.92-428.92 :  Just that.
428.92-431.92 :  Not because of color strength?
431.92-432.92 :  Yeah.
432.92-433.92 :  Okay.
433.92-434.92 :  What about the other...
434.92-436.92 :  The last check?
436.92-439.92 :  It's two things.
448.92-449.92 :  Okay.
449.92-452.92 :  The case, what is it, what's single and double?
452.92-455.92 :  You see those two are one-privileged.
455.92-458.92 :  So, we want double colors?
458.92-459.92 :  Yeah.
459.92-460.92 :  Okay.
460.92-461.92 :  And...
461.92-463.92 :  Not thick.
463.92-465.92 :  You're any rubber or...
465.92-467.92 :  I'm not going to have to skip.
467.92-468.92 :  Okay.
468.92-471.92 :  And we want it special colors.
471.92-473.92 :  Oh no, wait.
473.92-475.92 :  We thought how many colors did we not have?
475.92-477.92 :  So, the case itself, one color.
477.92-479.92 :  It's one special color.
479.92-480.92 :  One color, okay.
480.92-482.92 :  The case unit itself, right?
482.92-483.92 :  Okay.
483.92-486.92 :  So, it's like a bit of third option we have.
486.92-488.92 :  Yes, the third one.
488.92-489.92 :  One.
489.92-491.92 :  Yeah, that's the difference.
491.92-492.92 :  Okay.
492.92-494.92 :  And then button.
494.92-495.92 :  And then watch.
495.92-497.92 :  And then click on it.
497.92-498.92 :  Maybe click.
498.92-501.92 :  We've got push buttons as well.
501.92-505.92 :  Like always, push button and then switch.
505.92-506.92 :  Okay.
506.92-508.92 :  You've got one button for this.
508.92-509.92 :  Okay.
509.92-510.92 :  Okay.
510.92-511.92 :  Okay.
511.92-512.92 :  Okay.
512.92-513.92 :  Okay.
513.92-516.92 :  Let's just be safe and put an active form.
516.92-517.92 :  Okay.
517.92-518.92 :  Okay.
518.92-521.92 :  And maybe a special color for...
521.92-522.92 :  Before.
522.92-523.92 :  Before?
523.92-527.92 :  So, why are we running the button?
527.92-531.92 :  Because that's one button, but it's the complexity of the work.
531.92-532.92 :  Okay.
532.92-534.92 :  So, I'm done for.
534.92-535.92 :  Yeah.
535.92-536.92 :  Okay.
536.92-540.92 :  Are we launching them?
540.92-541.92 :  No.
541.92-542.92 :  No.
542.92-545.92 :  I'm just going to have to fix it.
545.92-546.92 :  So, we're...
546.92-548.92 :  We'll be quite followed.
548.92-550.92 :  Something's going to have to go.
550.92-552.92 :  We're at 16.8.
552.92-554.92 :  And how...
554.92-559.92 :  How we want to achieve this higher product?
559.92-565.92 :  Well, something has to go to the two and it's 2.3 euro.
565.92-568.92 :  So, let me say, what are we...
568.92-569.92 :  5.2?
569.92-570.92 :  5.2.
570.92-571.92 :  Oh, yes.
571.92-572.92 :  So, I'm 4.2.
572.92-573.92 :  So...
573.92-574.92 :  I'm thinking 1.
574.92-576.92 :  So, we could see it first.
576.92-578.92 :  So, you...
578.92-579.92 :  And then what?
579.92-580.92 :  How much would that save?
580.92-582.92 :  I'm not sure that's the only save you 1.1.
582.92-585.92 :  The other thing could be that you could pick the way
585.92-586.92 :  the else is you can.
586.92-588.92 :  You can launch a theater.
588.92-590.92 :  Because when you...
590.92-591.92 :  There's something on the TV.
591.92-594.92 :  The TV responds at the end as well.
594.92-596.92 :  So, the music could be looking at the TV.
596.92-598.92 :  Or, it may not be...
598.92-600.92 :  Don't want me to scroll.
600.92-602.92 :  You need to simply get the TV respond.
602.92-603.92 :  Okay, so...
603.92-605.92 :  Which I think is the technical proof of the TV.
605.92-609.92 :  So, what sort of use suggests we take away the LCD flash?
609.92-610.92 :  Yep.
611.92-614.92 :  And the advanced should go the way as well?
614.92-618.92 :  To be replaced with a regular chip.
621.92-623.92 :  So, we're that easy, sir.
623.92-625.92 :  So, we've got 23 to get in.
625.92-627.92 :  And...
627.92-630.92 :  Where in the four push buttons are?
630.92-633.92 :  The 12 buttons that you see there.
633.92-635.92 :  12 buttons?
635.92-637.92 :  You need to select the best you have to go.
637.92-638.92 :  I'm showing you.
638.92-641.92 :  The set's all four is a good estimate for...
641.92-642.92 :  Do you think?
642.92-643.92 :  Yeah.
643.92-645.92 :  You can't actually cut...
645.92-647.92 :  It's like three times the number of buttons.
647.92-648.92 :  Okay.
648.92-649.92 :  4 8 12.
649.92-652.92 :  Is that one big button for the 12 buttons?
653.92-656.92 :  It needs to be more than one big button.
656.92-658.92 :  Because she opened up the four.
658.92-660.92 :  So, one button.
660.92-662.92 :  She's like panel.
662.92-663.92 :  So, okay.
663.92-666.92 :  Well, we have clearly stated it.
667.92-669.92 :  She's reporting.
670.92-671.92 :  Or the colors.
671.92-673.92 :  You know, take away the colors.
673.92-677.92 :  But we can just scroll away and have a normal color.
678.92-681.92 :  What do you want colors to change in the year?
681.92-683.92 :  No, that's not the button here.
683.92-685.92 :  The buttons only need to be cut.
685.92-686.92 :  Right.
686.92-687.92 :  So...
687.92-689.92 :  Get that else.
691.92-693.92 :  It's back to the year.
693.92-697.92 :  So, then these just become normal color colors.
697.92-699.92 :  That might be something to me.
699.92-701.92 :  Okay.
701.92-702.92 :  Offer.
702.92-704.92 :  And...
704.92-706.92 :  Right.
706.92-708.92 :  So, take away that completely.
709.92-711.92 :  And then we're implemented.
711.92-714.92 :  So, we do have to point five years today, which is a little bit...
714.92-715.92 :  And...
715.92-719.92 :  And we're with embossing mode of this method of conscious.
719.92-721.92 :  So, thank you.
721.92-723.92 :  That's a pretty long period of time.
723.92-726.92 :  Yeah, you get that idea.
726.92-729.92 :  One.
729.92-733.92 :  Something that one button, especially for...
733.92-735.92 :  Maybe a little bit more.
735.92-736.92 :  Yeah.
737.92-739.92 :  Well, there we go.
739.92-742.92 :  So, instead of doing this, we're not going to have to add CDM.
742.92-746.92 :  We're just going to have along the CDO show you what you're doing.
746.92-748.92 :  It's going to get better.
748.92-751.92 :  And you can do this thing here.
754.92-758.92 :  Was the goal in your prototype design?
758.92-761.92 :  Could it be as low profile as possible?
761.92-763.92 :  Sort of flash.
764.92-766.92 :  Yeah.
766.92-769.92 :  Yeah, it's going to be pretty good.
769.92-771.92 :  Yeah.
771.92-773.92 :  Yeah.
773.92-775.92 :  Yeah, right.
775.92-777.92 :  Okay, just stop.
777.92-780.92 :  So, there's one more damage to the...
780.92-782.92 :  Yeah.
782.92-784.92 :  Thank you.
784.92-786.92 :  Right, okay.
786.92-789.92 :  So, just to let's do pro then.
789.92-792.92 :  We applied to a bike box recently.
792.92-793.92 :  Okay.
793.92-795.92 :  And then, so, height wise.
801.92-803.92 :  I thought it was a thing.
803.92-804.92 :  Right back there.
804.92-806.92 :  I like to use it.
806.92-808.92 :  She's not very high at all.
808.92-810.92 :  This is high up.
812.92-813.92 :  It's slightly more.
813.92-814.92 :  Yeah.
814.92-817.92 :  So, we have it within the...
817.92-819.92 :  It's a bit so too thin.
819.92-821.92 :  Okay.
821.92-824.92 :  So, we have it within core.
824.92-828.92 :  And so, we have project evaluation.
828.92-831.92 :  And how do I do it?
831.92-833.92 :  Okay.
833.92-837.92 :  Okay, so can we close that?
837.92-840.92 :  This is what it's going to be.
840.92-843.92 :  So, I'm just going to have to...
843.92-845.92 :  Yeah, that's fine.
845.92-848.92 :  It's probably just...
848.92-850.92 :  It's worth getting into it.
850.92-853.92 :  Just to watch you stylish.
853.92-856.92 :  You think I'll look more at the bottom, but in grid.
856.92-859.92 :  Because I've seen there's lots of devices out there.
859.92-862.92 :  Instead of taking it, you're standard and not...
862.92-863.92 :  It's very grid.
863.92-866.92 :  And how it sort of stylized and different concept.
866.92-868.92 :  I think that's the thing.
868.92-869.92 :  It's the edge.
869.92-870.92 :  Yeah.
870.92-873.92 :  The strip that we want to go with is what we're going to show.
873.92-875.92 :  The look in color is cool.
875.92-876.92 :  Yeah.
876.92-878.92 :  I think we're going to talk about that.
878.92-879.92 :  Okay.
879.92-881.92 :  So, what do you want to say?
881.92-882.92 :  Square buttons.
882.92-884.92 :  Yeah, let me shake my key.
884.92-885.92 :  I'm going to do that.
885.92-888.92 :  You should shake it rather than finishing it.
888.92-889.92 :  Okay.
889.92-892.92 :  So, we're going to do the telephone.
892.92-893.92 :  Okay.
893.92-894.92 :  Okay.
894.92-895.92 :  Right?
895.92-903.92 :  So, at this point, we discussed...
903.92-906.92 :  I've satisfied your order.
906.92-909.92 :  I think that it needs more points.
909.92-912.92 :  You're into creating things.
912.92-913.92 :  You could like...
913.92-915.92 :  You should think too much.
915.92-918.92 :  Stuffy much for everything.
918.92-919.92 :  And...
919.92-920.92 :  It's too much.
920.92-923.92 :  You want me to...
923.92-931.92 :  You want me to do my design, though?
931.92-934.92 :  I wouldn't really share what that was.
934.92-935.92 :  Yeah.
935.92-937.92 :  You could go for that part.
937.92-941.92 :  I wouldn't really share what he was just using.
941.92-942.92 :  You could.
942.92-943.92 :  All right.
943.92-945.92 :  So, the way this works is fun and powerful.
945.92-946.92 :  Okay.
946.92-948.92 :  And there's the biggest possible.
948.92-949.92 :  I'm not counting.
949.92-950.92 :  Shh.
950.92-951.92 :  Let's see.
951.92-952.92 :  Let's go over your head.
952.92-953.92 :  It's okay.
953.92-955.92 :  No, you need the power.
955.92-956.92 :  Is that?
956.92-957.92 :  It's okay.
957.92-959.92 :  I don't need the power.
959.92-960.92 :  I have the power.
960.92-961.92 :  Call it.
961.92-962.92 :  Oh, of course.
962.92-964.92 :  There's no power.
964.92-966.92 :  You need the power.
966.92-967.92 :  Shh.
967.92-969.92 :  Shh.
969.92-970.92 :  Shh.
970.92-971.92 :  Shh.
971.92-975.92 :  So, what this is is a press to use power.
975.92-977.92 :  I should...
977.92-981.92 :  That is it, I set up a review on the points of discussion.
981.92-983.92 :  From the beginning.
983.92-986.92 :  Use that criteria to evaluate.
986.92-987.92 :  She's for that.
987.92-991.92 :  For the current design.
991.92-992.92 :  It's fun.
992.92-995.92 :  And speak and review that.
995.92-998.92 :  I think it's going to be the financial piece.
998.92-1001.92 :  I'm not going to probably use it to change.
1001.92-1005.92 :  Is it something you could do?
1005.92-1007.92 :  Yeah, it could be good.
1007.92-1010.92 :  And I'm going to write up our results and board.
1010.92-1012.92 :  It's going to be a way for us to go through it.
1012.92-1015.92 :  Decide if we're going to be the worst.
1015.92-1016.92 :  Okay.
1017.92-1023.92 :  So, so sort of bring together two things.
1023.92-1026.92 :  Design, gold, and also the market research we had.
1026.92-1029.92 :  When we rate this one is five.
1029.92-1030.92 :  Six seeding.
1030.92-1032.92 :  Fitting the original nine.
1032.92-1033.92 :  Seven is low.
1033.92-1034.92 :  Okay.
1034.92-1039.92 :  At least, we've been asked to collected the rate
1039.92-1043.92 :  that so we can just try and just keep work on a consensus system.
1044.92-1046.92 :  We just come to an agreement.
1046.92-1047.92 :  Okay.
1047.92-1052.92 :  So, first one, the stylish looking field.
1052.92-1053.92 :  I think that's the handy.
1053.92-1057.92 :  Yeah, it's encouraging us to be able to do it pretty good.
1057.92-1059.92 :  I don't know about the six.
1059.92-1063.92 :  Yeah, my only reservation one is that we basically want the yellow
1063.92-1065.92 :  because it's a company's color.
1065.92-1068.92 :  And the yellows can really be a hit.
1068.92-1070.92 :  Right.
1070.92-1071.92 :  Okay.
1072.92-1073.92 :  Do you guys think?
1073.92-1075.92 :  I would say five is six.
1075.92-1076.92 :  Okay.
1076.92-1077.92 :  Yep.
1077.92-1078.92 :  One time.
1078.92-1079.92 :  Okay.
1079.92-1082.92 :  Oh, it's actually one is seven.
1082.92-1083.92 :  Oh, yeah.
1083.92-1085.92 :  So, and I would say two.
1085.92-1086.92 :  Three.
1087.92-1089.92 :  Wait, what's the scale?
1089.92-1090.92 :  One is seven.
1090.92-1091.92 :  Ten.
1091.92-1092.92 :  One is five.
1092.92-1094.92 :  Okay, here I do.
1094.92-1096.92 :  Okay.
1096.92-1098.92 :  Five is six.
1098.92-1100.92 :  Okay.
1100.92-1102.92 :  So, high technology.
1102.92-1104.92 :  Three, that's a good job.
1104.92-1107.92 :  Okay, so we have to remove two of our features.
1107.92-1109.92 :  We want it, but jump dial.
1109.92-1111.92 :  Which is more.
1111.92-1114.92 :  So, you can.
1114.92-1116.92 :  I'd say it's more.
1116.92-1117.92 :  Okay.
1117.92-1118.92 :  Three.
1118.92-1119.92 :  Okay.
1119.92-1121.92 :  Okay.
1121.92-1125.92 :  Star reflects fruit inspired colors.
1125.92-1127.92 :  She said colors.
1127.92-1128.92 :  Okay.
1128.92-1139.72 :  colors and don't actually represent colors. Yeah. The yellow is more representative of color
1139.72-1152.96 :  but in itself you can create those two. And design is simple in use, simple features. Yeah, really
1152.96-1166.60 :  different. And I get that in your watch. Yep. Soft and spongy, which is that it is mostly
1196.60-1213.66 :  very good. And so it then budgeted. And say them as possible. How do you put them? Yeah, 49 with
1213.66-1243.18 :  zero being high. Pretty good. Kind of like something like that. Right. I think
1243.18-1255.18 :  if you turn that into 100, it would be a tight fan. So you hurt that. So yeah, well, you have
1255.18-1263.58 :  60, 90. Oh, right. Pretty good. Okay. That was just a little fun.
1272.78-1281.42 :  Maybe the third. I'm asleep. I'm calm. Is that your answer? Yeah, that's me. I didn't have one other
1281.42-1288.70 :  frame. I thought I mean, I'm not knowing how we would deal with this information. I thought, okay, in
1288.70-1296.30 :  theory, this kind of process that we're finding our design. It's not something pushed through, but I thought you're
1296.30-1303.02 :  thinking more about dimensions. Sort of like more of three-dimensional shapes as well. So just that flat.
1304.30-1309.42 :  Could I design more of a series of colors? That it's more like a line. I don't know like the
1309.42-1316.22 :  harvest line and the vibrant line. Whatever. Some theme or different pounds on three.
1318.14-1322.78 :  It's just discussion and the honesty we just abandoned the fun. Just thinking about what we were
1325.82-1336.78 :  Yeah. Okay, great. Are you submitting the evaluation criteria for I don't know your instruction?
1339.50-1343.66 :  I think they record it. I haven't been asked to see any of it. Okay.
1345.34-1349.02 :  Just going to send it to the minute because it's just a very random one. I love it.
1352.86-1358.86 :  Right. Well next up then because we've done the final is the project evaluation.
1360.62-1363.26 :  See, I'm not missing this training corporate logo.
1364.14-1371.66 :  on the vinyl track and back pussy, might be the final touch it.
1388.30-1390.14 :  don't you just charge it.
1393.26-1411.10 :  Do you want to just in this week that you think about about these four points and not
1411.10-1414.10 :  these four points?
1444.10-1451.10 :  I have no idea what this after that, I have no idea what this is.
1451.10-1452.10 :  Sure.
1452.10-1453.10 :  So what is it you asked me?
1453.10-1454.10 :  I do not know.
1454.10-1458.10 :  You are opinion on this four points and how do you...
1458.10-1460.10 :  You serve our work on this?
1460.10-1461.10 :  Yes.
1461.10-1469.10 :  Well obviously to your system, the room is in the institution.
1469.10-1477.10 :  But the main thing is, I think, I am using this space as more just to report on this
1477.10-1480.10 :  supposed to be creative and constructive.
1480.10-1485.10 :  You probably helped to have sort of a cumulative effect.
1485.10-1489.10 :  You have ideas that come back, but the ideas are still in discussion.
1489.10-1494.10 :  You know, even though this sort of center point creative was in the reality of going to this,
1494.10-1497.10 :  it is not really a big more interesting thing.
1497.10-1502.10 :  Do you feel that you were able to have put on creative experience?
1502.10-1507.10 :  Yes, but that is just the thing is the question that comes to the first point that the room feels
1507.10-1512.10 :  and creativity goes on, the need to come here and put out our ideas.
1512.10-1516.10 :  I do not know what it means to do with this space.
1516.10-1519.10 :  It means that you are right on that.
1519.10-1522.10 :  I just looked up and said what it means to do with this space.
1522.10-1523.10 :  Oh yeah.
1523.10-1524.10 :  I do not know.
1524.10-1529.10 :  I think it means that it means to do with this space.
1529.10-1530.10 :  Yes.
1530.10-1531.10 :  Okay.
1531.10-1539.10 :  The question is, I would say that actually there are sort of teams of creative and ambitious
1539.10-1546.10 :  who are asked to work through this, but actually the guy longs a fairly contrived.
1546.10-1547.10 :  Okay.
1547.10-1551.10 :  Fashion trends, if you are in vegetable color scheme, then it is always one of these.
1551.10-1552.10 :  How many colors?
1552.10-1561.10 :  We are talking about the things that style and feel technology, but built in 12 and a half.
1561.10-1566.10 :  So actually the creativity is one and one about that.
1566.10-1568.10 :  Certainly, about.
1568.10-1571.10 :  Like cage, you can do whatever you like.
1571.10-1572.10 :  It is very strengths.
1572.10-1573.10 :  It is like a little unique.
1573.10-1574.10 :  It goes so big.
1574.10-1575.10 :  That is a very interesting.
1575.10-1579.10 :  I do not actually let it take each point and we will be discussing it.
1579.10-1581.10 :  So still on the topic of room for today.
1581.10-1582.10 :  It is a bit difficult.
1582.10-1589.10 :  My idea for it is quite a fun experience.
1589.10-1596.10 :  At the end you have got to open up because you are not a mom.
1596.10-1601.10 :  I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions and meetings.
1601.10-1606.10 :  So I am also very compact in the structure.
1606.10-1611.10 :  Because for brainstorming you want to show that allows you the ideas to get past.
1611.10-1616.10 :  It is very evaluated to review and to keep that in mind.
1616.10-1620.10 :  I guess that point about the room not being very friendly to that.
1620.10-1622.10 :  I think that is a very good thing.
1622.10-1625.10 :  Big fact that we are using the scripts.
1625.10-1628.10 :  I feel it because I wear my glasses.
1628.10-1630.10 :  But that irritates me.
1630.10-1635.10 :  It does actually affect how whether you feel comfortable to communicate with people.
1635.10-1638.10 :  I feel like I am hiding behind the foot.
1638.10-1640.10 :  I feel it is a very comfortable set.
1640.10-1642.10 :  So you are more relaxed.
1642.10-1644.10 :  Not so much an attitude.
1644.10-1646.10 :  That attitude is very relaxed.
1646.10-1650.10 :  It is a very good foundation.
1650.10-1653.10 :  And the time given of the script.
1654.10-1657.10 :  Or by leadership.
1664.10-1670.10 :  My sense of guidance and direction.
1670.10-1673.10 :  I think that is the best.
1673.10-1676.10 :  Yes, I think that is the best.
1677.10-1680.10 :  I think that is the best.
1680.10-1682.10 :  My first reason.
1682.10-1686.10 :  Only leadership that affected leadership.
1686.10-1690.10 :  Just people are saying freedom, delegation, that they have access.
1690.10-1693.10 :  And they are saying that they are very honest.
1693.10-1695.10 :  And they are just thoughtless.
1695.10-1698.10 :  In reality, I think here the different elements of leadership.
1698.10-1702.10 :  The original brief thinking of the personal coach.
1703.10-1708.10 :  I think that you can get this quite a key.
1708.10-1711.10 :  Quite a key in finding framework to work with.
1711.10-1713.10 :  And so it is leadership.
1713.10-1716.10 :  It is the point of this power.
1716.10-1719.10 :  It is the number.
1719.10-1721.10 :  But it is not bad leadership.
1721.10-1723.10 :  It is just very strong.
1723.10-1727.10 :  It turns the individual in more of that.
1727.10-1730.10 :  So freedom is a method.
1730.10-1733.10 :  So there may be a number of two controlling.
1733.10-1736.10 :  Or I think without controlling.
1736.10-1739.10 :  The interaction is very structured.
1739.10-1741.10 :  And the structure is only what you see.
1741.10-1744.10 :  Each individual is structured in one particular house.
1744.10-1747.10 :  Rather than controlling it.
1747.10-1750.10 :  And the position has been made.
1750.10-1752.10 :  And it presents the track.
1752.10-1754.10 :  You go around and think about it.
1754.10-1756.10 :  But that process.
1756.10-1759.10 :  So you have to do it in a way.
1759.10-1762.10 :  And you might want to do it in a creative process.
1762.10-1765.10 :  Yeah.
1765.10-1768.10 :  Okay. What about two?
1768.10-1771.10 :  Two.
1771.10-1774.10 :  Two.
1774.10-1777.10 :  Two.
1777.10-1781.10 :  Two.
1781.10-1784.10 :  Two.
1784.10-1787.10 :  Two.
1787.10-1790.10 :  Two.
1790.10-1791.10 :  Two.
1791.10-1794.10 :  Two.
1794.10-1796.10 :  Two.
1796.10-1797.10 :  Two.
1797.10-1799.10 :  Two.
1799.10-1800.10 :  Two.
1800.10-1801.10 :  Two.
1801.10-1802.10 :  Two.
1802.10-1803.10 :  Um.
1803.10-1809.10 :  So I think that if we can get outside, we just could pass.
1809.10-1813.10 :  You know, just like, could pass with the sports team at the club.
1813.10-1820.10 :  I think the tools that they've given the tools at the Open Interest are antsy, but they don't support the energy.
1820.10-1822.10 :  They support the team working together.
1822.10-1823.10 :  Yeah, we're not the kids.
1823.10-1825.10 :  They're still very individual.
1825.10-1835.10 :  So taking upon that idea where I see this, we've had this structure in which we approach this whole pass.
1835.10-1843.10 :  It's quite contrary to the principal of teamwork because the tasks with the sort of divide them.
1843.10-1846.10 :  And then the work went on in isolation.
1846.10-1848.10 :  I don't know what you guys did.
1848.10-1849.10 :  We really did.
1849.10-1858.10 :  But actually, if you imagine that you're entirely the same, ask giving to us.
1858.10-1865.10 :  But first thing we have to do is come up with a design concept.
1865.10-1867.10 :  And we sit here together and do it.
1867.10-1868.10 :  Yeah.
1868.10-1871.10 :  But that's what he gets to say that we go off and do the competition.
1871.10-1877.10 :  It's actually sort of predisposing to quite contrary to teamwork.
1877.10-1879.10 :  Not that we haven't done it yet.
1879.10-1880.10 :  That's what we could have done.
1880.10-1881.10 :  We can't.
1881.10-1882.10 :  The status of it.
1882.10-1883.10 :  Yeah.
1883.10-1893.10 :  And what about the Hollywood youth whiteboard youth and project youth?
1893.10-1900.10 :  Does anybody think that it's a really useful and appealing?
1900.10-1906.10 :  I think the whiteboard for me is the kind of thing I would use all the time.
1906.10-1910.10 :  But it's not quite as useful as it was to us.
1910.10-1912.10 :  Could it be these things?
1912.10-1917.10 :  In the sense that once we have an idea out there, a lot of work we put on between these.
1917.10-1925.10 :  That could have been up on a board and opposed to text.
1925.10-1928.10 :  And then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that.
1928.10-1932.10 :  I know that people would just on cars and the aviation would put off.
1932.10-1935.10 :  And we would just have simple like finalized prototype.
1935.10-1939.10 :  And it's completely abstract and final product.
1939.10-1941.10 :  But they use it as a kind of context.
1941.10-1943.10 :  So we offer it and puzzle it.
1943.10-1945.10 :  Very point to discuss.
1945.10-1949.10 :  And the way everybody's as we discussed things in theoretically out of our notebooks.
1949.10-1953.10 :  We're just, we're actually just each of us discussing something each of them up.
1953.10-1956.10 :  It wasn't until we had this here.
1956.10-1959.10 :  Like I once find out, peek the cross and look at the correct paper.
1959.10-1960.10 :  Now I know it is deep.
1960.10-1966.10 :  So that size, but the vote whiteboard could actually be this kind of thing.
1966.10-1971.10 :  So do you think producing a proof of type earlier and process would have been a good idea?
1971.10-1977.10 :  I think the focus of it is on PowerPoint as close to the whiteboard.
1977.10-1978.10 :  Anything with that.
1978.10-1979.10 :  Yeah.
1979.10-1985.10 :  It's also that it will be cooler to have the whiteboard.
1986.10-1991.10 :  The PowerPoint will be the whiteboard PowerPoint in the same place.
1991.10-1992.10 :  Yeah.
1992.10-1993.10 :  Yeah.
1993.10-1996.10 :  Because the PowerPoint is providing to us probably a time pair.
1996.10-2003.10 :  Whereas I can imagine if I'd be encouraged to use pink brush, for example, or whatever I would have actually used.
2003.10-2009.10 :  Because that's how we want to set up to use all of that.
2009.10-2010.10 :  Okay.
2010.10-2014.10 :  I think that there are two new PowerPoints in this.
2014.10-2016.10 :  It's like in a new PowerPoint.
2016.10-2017.10 :  We spell our padding.
2017.10-2019.10 :  And all our information on the PowerPoints.
2019.10-2021.10 :  We don't think it's in yet.
2021.10-2023.10 :  You could have gone through them.
2023.10-2024.10 :  We'll do it to my side.
2024.10-2025.10 :  Okay.
2025.10-2026.10 :  We'll put it in.
2026.10-2031.10 :  All of our digital pens to find an idea of the page.
2031.10-2033.10 :  That's true.
2033.10-2034.10 :  Yeah.
2034.10-2037.10 :  Can't you agree?
2037.10-2038.10 :  Thank you.
2038.10-2039.10 :  Take a.
2040.10-2045.10 :  I think you can take it before you go off.
2045.10-2047.10 :  It's getting very popular.
2047.10-2048.10 :  Yeah.
2048.10-2049.10 :  You can take it.
2049.10-2054.10 :  I think at the very start of today, I wrote a whole new stuff.
2054.10-2056.10 :  Didn't click the note from one.
2056.10-2058.10 :  Then went back and wrote one tiny thing.
2058.10-2060.10 :  Then they clicked notes.
2060.10-2063.10 :  So I'm quite worried that I actually wrote new PowerPoints.
2063.10-2065.10 :  But that's not very different.
2066.10-2069.10 :  I think the pen is very difficult to do.
2069.10-2071.10 :  It's very difficult to do.
2071.10-2072.10 :  Yeah.
2072.10-2074.10 :  Pen is good.
2074.10-2077.10 :  On the top of the technology, it's just a curtain.
2077.10-2079.10 :  You can move our computers.
2079.10-2083.10 :  It's just a curtain.
2083.10-2084.10 :  Yeah.
2084.10-2085.10 :  We only need one computer.
2085.10-2086.10 :  We only need one computer.
2086.10-2087.10 :  Yeah.
2087.10-2088.10 :  There had been a fifth.
2088.10-2090.10 :  They just been sitting there.
2090.10-2093.10 :  And the computer may not be conducive to reading.
2094.10-2096.10 :  You can't be looking to computer.
2096.10-2097.10 :  You want to.
2097.10-2098.10 :  And it only should be.
2098.10-2099.10 :  Check some.
2099.10-2100.10 :  Yeah.
2100.10-2101.10 :  Yeah.
2101.10-2102.10 :  It's useful.
2102.10-2104.10 :  Do you think the computer is just providing distraction?
2104.10-2107.10 :  I think too many computers are just distracting.
2110.10-2112.10 :  I like to have things written on them.
2112.10-2113.10 :  Yes, indeed.
2113.10-2117.10 :  A lot of the stuff that is revealed to me, I ended up in a drive on that.
2117.10-2120.10 :  So I could look out at the sleep, not have the distraction.
2121.10-2122.10 :  I'm not really sure.
2122.10-2132.10 :  The little ones say new ideas find.
2132.10-2135.10 :  I don't know.
2135.10-2137.10 :  It's a good thing about anything else.
2137.10-2138.10 :  It would have been helpful.
2138.10-2139.10 :  That.
2139.10-2140.10 :  So.
2143.10-2144.10 :  Wow.
2144.10-2145.10 :  You.
2145.10-2146.10 :  You want to.
2146.10-2147.10 :  You want to.
2147.10-2148.10 :  I think.
2148.10-2149.10 :  The process.
2149.10-2151.10 :  Net and the natural.
2151.10-2152.10 :  Contents.
2152.10-2154.10 :  Would not have been.
2154.10-2157.10 :  Interrupted by this necessity.
2157.10-2158.10 :  To.
2158.10-2159.10 :  This.
2159.10-2164.10 :  That's kind of a new idea for me is like a certain idea.
2164.10-2165.10 :  What.
2165.10-2166.10 :  What.
2166.10-2167.10 :  What.
2167.10-2168.10 :  What.
2168.10-2169.10 :  What.
2169.10-2170.10 :  What.
2170.10-2171.10 :  What.
2171.10-2172.10 :  What.
2172.10-2173.10 :  Yeah.
2173.10-2174.10 :  I don't know.
2174.10-2175.10 :  I.
2175.10-2181.10 :  I think it's quite good that we have time and it's been moving because the really could have
2181.10-2182.10 :  run on.
2182.10-2184.10 :  I might have been meeting with that.
2184.10-2189.10 :  But the only thing is the like we've had on making a conceptual design.
2189.10-2190.10 :  I thought very.
2190.10-2191.10 :  Maybe another two minutes.
2191.10-2201.10 :  I think maybe it's like holding on to the one room.
2201.10-2208.10 :  And we just said like every hour is something everybody is actually having a short meeting.
2208.10-2209.10 :  And then just.
2209.10-2211.10 :  Just to have like something that's done.
2211.10-2212.10 :  Just like the.
2212.10-2213.10 :  My.
2213.10-2214.10 :  I'm.
2214.10-2215.10 :  I.
2215.10-2216.10 :  I'm.
2216.10-2217.10 :  Having.
2217.10-2218.10 :  I'm.
2218.10-2219.10 :  You.
2219.10-2220.10 :  So.
2220.10-2221.10 :  Including.
2221.10-2223.10 :  I haven't got my five minutes to go.
2223.10-2224.10 :  I think I'll do it.
2224.10-2225.10 :  Five minutes to go.
2225.10-2226.10 :  You get.
2226.10-2227.10 :  Are the costs in budget.
2227.10-2228.10 :  Yes they are.
2228.10-2229.10 :  And it's.
2229.10-2230.10 :  Project value.
2230.10-2231.10 :  Yes it is.
2231.10-2232.10 :  So.
2232.10-2233.10 :  So.
2233.10-2234.10 :  I.
2234.10-2235.10 :  So.
2235.10-2236.10 :  So.
2236.10-2237.10 :  I.
2237.10-2238.10 :  So.
2238.10-2239.10 :  I.
2239.10-2240.10 :  We're apparently not.
2240.10-2241.10 :  I.
2241.10-2242.10 :  One.
2242.10-2243.10 :  One.
2243.10-2244.10 :  Oh wow.
2244.10-2245.10 :  That is.
2245.10-2246.10 :  What did you tell?
2246.10-2247.10 :  What did you tell?
2247.10-2248.10 :  What did you tell?
2248.10-2249.10 :  What did you tell?
2249.10-2250.10 :  What did you tell?
2250.10-2251.10 :  What did you tell?
2251.10-2252.10 :  What did you tell?
2252.10-2253.10 :  What did you tell?
2253.10-2255.10 :  See it looks like home or city.
2255.10-2256.10 :  So it's.
2256.10-2257.10 :  So it's made in your hand.
2257.10-2259.10 :  Councillor Delin seeing.
2259.10-2260.10 :  Yeah it's just a local home.
2260.10-2261.10 :  The Aaría.
2261.10-2262.10 :  Aara.
2262.10-2265.10 :  wooden Opuh.
2265.10-2266.10 :  Yeah.
2266.10-2267.10 :  But the redest.
2267.10-2268.10 :  Was.
2268.10-2270.10 :  What I see on cost.
2270.10-2272.10 :  In happy.
2272.10-2274.10 :  Fashion technology.
2274.10-2275.10 :  Yeah.
2275.10-2276.10 :  So you can wear home.
2276.10-2277.10 :  Okay.
2277.10-2278.10 :  You can slow folks.
2278.10-2279.10 :  ownership.
2279.10-2280.10 :  Dog.
2280.10-2281.10 :  Call.
2281.10-2282.10 :  I've.
2282.10-2283.10 :  And slightly gathered.
2283.10-2286.10 :  But will you pass themпис wh reacts거든요?
2286.10-2290.10 :  Maybe she's not a real reaction to get some of that.
2290.10-2291.10 :  Oh, I did it.
2291.10-2292.10 :  It's a little...
2292.10-2294.10 :  No, it is.
2294.10-2296.10 :  It is, you've caught it.
2296.10-2299.10 :  It is conceptualising.
2299.10-2300.10 :  You can...
2300.10-2303.10 :  It's like you said something you can put your hands on your feet and hands you have.
2303.10-2307.10 :  Yeah, it's like you were playing the piano and the ideas came with play-doh.
2307.10-2308.10 :  Did they?
2308.10-2310.10 :  Rather than you're talking about something like that.
2310.10-2311.10 :  Yeah.
2311.10-2312.10 :  I'm just flinging.
2312.10-2313.10 :  I don't know.
2313.10-2315.10 :  Yeah, it's not something.
2315.10-2317.10 :  It's not something.
2317.10-2319.10 :  Yeah, it's not something.
2319.10-2321.10 :  It's not something that's...
2321.10-2323.10 :  The opposite.
2323.10-2324.10 :  And you have to be...
2324.10-2327.10 :  It's just me, it's something that you want.
2327.10-2331.10 :  And so, what are your summaries and what's that?
2331.10-2333.10 :  It's helpful to the breathing process.
2333.10-2335.10 :  It engages all your senses.
2335.10-2339.10 :  Not just your sight, but your hands are pure touch.
2339.10-2342.10 :  And it's helpful to understand.
2342.10-2343.10 :  I mentioned as well.
2343.10-2348.10 :  I think that it's very helpful because it's such to pop up where it's on a piece of paper.
2348.10-2349.10 :  And what?
2349.10-2354.10 :  Even with the treating graphically, it still requires a lot of energy.
2354.10-2356.10 :  Yeah, tangible.
2356.10-2358.10 :  And it's handy.
2358.10-2360.10 :  Mm-hmm.
2360.10-2362.10 :  Okay.
2362.10-2364.10 :  Okay.
2364.10-2366.10 :  Uh...
2366.10-2368.10 :  Mm-hmm.
2368.10-2370.10 :  Really much happiness.
2370.10-2371.10 :  Yep.
2371.10-2372.10 :  Are you sure?
2372.10-2373.10 :  Let's go.
2373.10-2374.10 :  Yeah.
2374.10-2376.10 :  I'm sure it's about a baby.
2376.10-2384.10 :  It's still me retreating to a higher position.
2384.10-2385.10 :  I'm getting caught.
2385.10-2387.10 :  You can let you get caught.
2387.10-2388.10 :  Yeah, right.
2388.10-2389.10 :  You can let you get caught.
2389.10-2390.10 :  Yeah, right.
2390.10-2391.10 :  What do you do?
2391.10-2392.10 :  Um, you show that all there.
2392.10-2393.10 :  Mm-hmm.
2393.10-2396.10 :  You're not my foot?
2396.10-2399.10 :  Yeah, yeah, I'm getting bigger.
2399.10-2400.10 :  Let's see.
2400.10-2403.10 :  My microphone has a TV.
2403.10-2404.10 :  Oh.
2404.10-2406.10 :  It's me.
2406.10-2407.10 :  It's me.
2407.10-2409.10 :  It's my leader.
2409.10-2419.10 :  I think it's my last run out.
2419.10-2421.10 :  I think it's my last run out.
2421.10-2423.10 :  I think it's getting more instruction.
2423.10-2425.10 :  Yeah.
2425.10-2427.10 :  Yeah.
2427.10-2429.10 :  Yeah.
2429.10-2431.10 :  Yeah.
2431.10-2433.10 :  Yeah.
2433.10-2435.10 :  Yeah.
2435.10-2437.10 :  Yeah.
2437.10-2439.10 :  Yeah.
2439.10-2441.10 :  Yeah.
2441.10-2443.10 :  Yeah.
2443.10-2445.10 :  Yeah.
2445.10-2447.10 :  Yeah.
2447.10-2448.10 :  Yeah.
2448.10-2449.10 :  Yeah.
2449.10-2450.10 :  Ooh yeah.
2450.10-2451.10 :  All right.
2451.10-2453.10 :  G Whatever
2474.10-2476.10 :  Okay.
2506.10-2508.10 :  you
2536.10-2538.10 :  you
2566.10-2568.10 :  you
2596.10-2598.10 :  you

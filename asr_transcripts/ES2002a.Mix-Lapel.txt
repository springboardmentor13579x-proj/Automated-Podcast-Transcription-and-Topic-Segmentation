 well Büro�. Thank you. Quality. Produced? I think it's already inside. I'm gonna sign that 거야. I think we have that size of idea where we're going to move and援 Yes, I do. Okay. Well, that's the key point for our project. And this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes. So first of all, make sure that you don't need others. I'm Laura and I'm a project manager. Nice. Can you introduce yourself today? Hi, I'm David and I'm supposed to be in the district. Okay. I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert. I'm David and I'm his employee. Okay. Okay. So we're designing a new remote control. And I have to record a piece here too. So it's David, I'm James Craig. And you arrive, don't you? Yes, we're designing a new remote control. It's a piece that's for your original trendier. That's kind of our break. We're live. And so there are three different stages to the design. I'm not sure what will be guys' ability to see each. I'm going to ask you to do that. You just got the project in that seat. Okay. Yeah. Sorry, the video doubts. Okay. So we're going to have individual work in a meeting by the repeat process three times. And this is when you get to try out the white voice over there. So get your favorite animal and sum up the pivot path. So here that's the way. All right. So. This one here, right? All right. Favorite animal. How big of a girl. Is that right? Yeah. I'm probably pretty pretty old. You're willing to take a lot of physical affection. And they have lots of personality. You fit and robust. Good. That's good. That one's bigger. That one's bigger. I'm going to be a monkey. And then the smoke. Sorry. One plant. Come real. I'm going to be up there. I'm going to be up there. You can take as long as it is you like. We do. Don't feel like you're in a rush. I could talk to a lot more about the. I'm going to be up there. Impressionist. Is that a wheel? Yeah. Well, I don't know. It's just the first animal I think off the top of my head. It's big reason is because I'm allergic to most animal. I'm allergic to my own. I'm allergic to my own. Yeah. I'm allergic to my own. I'm allergic to the dog as well. I'm allergic to the animal. It's my dog. I don't know. It's my dog. I see a dog in there. I see a rooster. Kindness. And he's a mixture of the various things. What thread I put him. That's the tip of the tip of the tool. And he's very friendly and teary and always used to see you. And very kind of affectionate. And he's quite wee as well. So he doesn't take up too much space. And he does a funnier tip to. Is he aware that this is on check? No, he's just. He does a happy thing. And it's always fun to get up and start chasing him. It's on him. Not a good adult. Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention for doing it. It's very good condition. Where does he find his just on here? Okay. Are you doing this? Okay. Okay. I need to discuss the content. So according to the break, we're going to be selling this. We're looking for this 25 year of. And we're in need to make 50 million here. And so we're going to be selling this on an international scale. And we don't want it to cost anymore than 1250 years. So we're going to be selling this. 50% to the 7. Can we just go over that again? Sure. So this. So cost like production cost is. All together. 1250 but selling price is that wholesale or retail. Like on the shelf. I don't know. I imagine that's a good thing. I think the problem is wholesale. It's a good thing. The retail. To sell it for the price I want. But I don't know. I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally. How do you design it? Yes. I think it will. Right away I'm wondering if there's like the DVD players there are zones. Oh yeah. Frequency. Yeah. As well as characters. Different. Keep ads styles. Yeah. But for our controllers you can probably be. That's because it's a lot complicated. It does make sense. Well, you could design a lot of you because. Yes. More complicated. Yeah. Yeah. And then and then the other thing in the national. On top of the price. Thinking. The price might might appeal to a certain market in one region. Where is another. Just to care just to care for us. Or just like basic product for the position. 25 euro. I'm not controlling my big head and London might not be such a big head. Greece. Yeah. Martin. I should be right on the stone. Right away. So I'm wondering. I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here. Okay, trendy probably means something other than just basic. Yeah. Something other than just. Standard. So I'm wondering right away is selling 25 years is that sort of. I mean, that's about like 18. 16 17 18. Yeah. I don't know how to make photo. I know. I get a lot of you. We got you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Does anybody have anything to add to. To the financial issue. Do you have any other back. No, actually, that would be useful. Can you like what your money would get you. Yeah, interesting thing about discussing the production of remote control for me is that as you point out, I just don't think the month control is being something something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. It's just like getting shoelaces and shoes. So you know, I mean like. Yeah. So like how do you. I mean, one way look at it. Well, the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy remote control. Or the way maybe people have TV sets really set up with their remote control. I really want better one. Right. Right. So in function, one of the priorities would be to combine the uses. Right. So do you think that should be like a man's line in the fire. You're like your telling me. Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of example of successful. But if these technology is palm, palm pilots, they're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras and the two players, pal phones, everything agenda. So like I wonder if we might add some new to the remote control markets, such as the lighting in your house or. For the night you need to buy. And what you want to watch. Like you might. I don't think it's an extra functionality. Yeah. Like personally for me at home, I've combined the audio video television set in my DVD player CD player. So they all work actually function together, but I have different remote controls. So it's sort of ironic that they're. You know, sound. This is one system. Each one's got its own. Okay. I'm going to have to wrap up pretty quickly. So anything else in the. And what they do. Okay. I need to see if I saw. Or you want to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when the first remote control my, my family had was on a cable. Actually the cable TV and big like buttons that sort of. On the blender. Right. And you know, I think about what they are now. It's better, but actually it's still kind of. And massive junky thing. And we could think about how. It could be more. You know, stream on. Like something like that. Or whatever would be. I can watch the. Okay. It could be that. It could be that. It could be that. It could be that. Functionally that doesn't make it better. Just the appeal. I'm not having. You know, these days it's really. Things that people's homes are becoming more and more like. She. Yeah. Nice material. Okay. Might be. Yeah. Yeah. We were exploring. Right. Well, so it is to wrap up the next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes. So that's about. About 10 to 12 months. And so in between nine then. As the investor with signer, you're going to be working on. Yeah. For user interface technical functions. And so it's. Yes. I guess that's. What. What I actually. And. And. And. And. And. You'll be. Just thinking about what it actually. You know what requirements. It has to. Has to fulfill. And you know, get instructions. Even. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it's the functional design stage of next. And. And. And. And. I got a little message. A lot of seniors might. I would. Before we wrap up just to make sure we're all in same page. Do we. We're given sort of an example of a coffee. She. Well. And. Are we. Right now in the assumption that our television remote control. May feature. Go beyond television. Or are we keeping sort of like a. Design. To. Television features. Okay. Well, just very confused. Who's supposed to finish. And. I guess that's up to us. I mean, you probably want some time. So. I mean, one factor would be. Because there's a cap there. So. Okay. Depends on how much you can cram into that price. Okay. Yeah. I think that's. I think. That's. I should. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. How do you turn this. I. Can. I. I. I. This is time to start. Try pushing function 8. Oh, Friday. Yeah, it's just 12 minutes. I'm trying to get it right. Nice. OK. Yeah. Really. Is not very five euro per cent. Do you guys give that to your friends? Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're thinking you're not happy with me. Hahaha. Who are you? Um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So, you're on the rise. Um, uh, I think you did it. That's the design project next semester. It's like a thing. Hahaha. Uh, thank you. Thank you. Of course you said you were. Um, well, I'm talking about you at this year. Yeah. Uh, uh, you did it on author and assistant, uh, an idea. Next semester. Oh, next semester. Um, you did it all too much. I don't know. Sorry. No, I didn't know. I only knew it was quite a bit difficult to do. That's not just then. That's not. It's not. I was not expecting the bad news.

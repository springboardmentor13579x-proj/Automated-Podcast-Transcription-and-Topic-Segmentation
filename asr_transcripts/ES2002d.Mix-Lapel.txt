 So, we're going to discuss the living field design, the geological design, the environment and the result of this meeting has to be a certain one, the details which we're going to do, obviously, climate design. And then I'm going to have to specify the design in the climate work. So, just from the last time to recap, so we're going to have a smooth handshake with no LCD display, which is a top-side, which is taken in the kinetic way. We're重 over ten times is not the one where we should have observations in us, There you are. Great. Here you go. I am going to do a little bit. I am going to do a little bit. I am going to do an extended, and then, extended, the color expenses, the average amount of the color, you know, instead, you can see this, and you start to vary by different, based on the size, the size, the color, and the button. Often, I am just going to put something in the bottom. And there isn't, there isn't up and up to the bottom. I think, I think, I think, it's still hidden for you. Right, there isn't. Where are they? They mean something to you, don't they? So, what kind of thing is going to be? I'll see you down on this display, on community, the name of our company. Right, new contents. We'll just say, it only has four colors, very simple to you. As many, the minimum amount, you get, it might even be one, bit of a complex, you can't, picture, simple to the, and what is this here? That's the number time. Where are we going to have the change? Um, oh, along the, yeah. The function. You have this space here, where the button is. It's always usually quite small, right? It's not quite huge, so, it's like, let's say a bunch of other side, so you still have quite a bit. So, if this is a fiscal, what kind of dimensions are you thinking? What, what, what, maybe the ones we've been in, that would be the two sides. Okay. So, that would be about some of you, but, but, you know, one, two, three, four, three, five, nine, seven, eight, ten centimeters. That would be good. The ten centimeters times is the same. And, I'll be good. In fact, ten is both ten centimeters usually. There are the, that's how we do it. That's great. It's very bright. So, um, is it possible, just going back to the idea of colors. This needs, I need some colors, and a production. And, uh, probably, you know, okay, so, let's go on the picture that goes. So, um, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, about, is there colors? Those're only emphasizes in terms of audition. Okay. Okay. Deaf,就是 tewin. Oh, we just ask, i highly, whyatter. How high is it? Not too high. But, Oh, oh, so deaf, doesn't that... It is pretty hard? You can skip the channel and do it for me. Well, it's not the way people do it. Because you've got the RCD and don't have it, you start with them and you start with one. And what else do you do for Joe's life? It's more about something like contrast color. Contrast? Brightness? No. It's whatever else we like doing things in the market. And you don't have to do the things that's why they're... Well, that's the design, but I like it. Not going to be easy. Do things like brightness contrast? Uh-huh. Do you choose the controls? The K-chance. You know, I'm the very input in the DCI. You could be in that. So, color is sharpness. Yeah, color is sharpness. A lot of these things will have to be three edges of the music with the green. Okay, we've got a sun setting, and you change the music. You have like your basic... The bass, your midrange, your high range. Yeah, bass and bounce. Yeah. That's right. Maybe you have pre-programmed sound, like the user could pick any and choose a sound board. But I think you could be... You could pick up the building and sound. Okay. You don't know the boat and the... That's fine. Just need to know if you know it. Okay. Right. I guess that's it. So, we've not... We've not had a little look at the excel sheet and price distance, the 32. 32, think, and so on. So, for this first part here, color one. You've actually... Do you have kinetic as well? No. Just that. Not because of color strength? Yeah. Okay. What about the other... The last check? It's two things. Okay. The case, what is it, what's single and double? You see those two are one-privileged. So, we want double colors? Yeah. Okay. And... Not thick. You're any rubber or... I'm not going to have to skip. Okay. And we want it special colors. Oh no, wait. We thought how many colors did we not have? So, the case itself, one color. It's one special color. One color, okay. The case unit itself, right? Okay. So, it's like a bit of third option we have. Yes, the third one. One. Yeah, that's the difference. Okay. And then button. And then watch. And then click on it. Maybe click. We've got push buttons as well. Like always, push button and then switch. Okay. You've got one button for this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's just be safe and put an active form. Okay. Okay. And maybe a special color for... Before. Before? So, why are we running the button? Because that's one button, but it's the complexity of the work. Okay. So, I'm done for. Yeah. Okay. Are we launching them? No. No. I'm just going to have to fix it. So, we're... We'll be quite followed. Something's going to have to go. We're at 16.8. And how... How we want to achieve this higher product? Well, something has to go to the two and it's 2.3 euro. So, let me say, what are we... 5.2? 5.2. Oh, yes. So, I'm 4.2. So... I'm thinking 1. So, we could see it first. So, you... And then what? How much would that save? I'm not sure that's the only save you 1.1. The other thing could be that you could pick the way the else is you can. You can launch a theater. Because when you... There's something on the TV. The TV responds at the end as well. So, the music could be looking at the TV. Or, it may not be... Don't want me to scroll. You need to simply get the TV respond. Okay, so... Which I think is the technical proof of the TV. So, what sort of use suggests we take away the LCD flash? Yep. And the advanced should go the way as well? To be replaced with a regular chip. So, we're that easy, sir. So, we've got 23 to get in. And... Where in the four push buttons are? The 12 buttons that you see there. 12 buttons? You need to select the best you have to go. I'm showing you. The set's all four is a good estimate for... Do you think? Yeah. You can't actually cut... It's like three times the number of buttons. Okay. 4 8 12. Is that one big button for the 12 buttons? It needs to be more than one big button. Because she opened up the four. So, one button. She's like panel. So, okay. Well, we have clearly stated it. She's reporting. Or the colors. You know, take away the colors. But we can just scroll away and have a normal color. What do you want colors to change in the year? No, that's not the button here. The buttons only need to be cut. Right. So... Get that else. It's back to the year. So, then these just become normal color colors. That might be something to me. Okay. Offer. And... Right. So, take away that completely. And then we're implemented. So, we do have to point five years today, which is a little bit... And... And we're with embossing mode of this method of conscious. So, thank you. That's a pretty long period of time. Yeah, you get that idea. One. Something that one button, especially for... Maybe a little bit more. Yeah. Well, there we go. So, instead of doing this, we're not going to have to add CDM. We're just going to have along the CDO show you what you're doing. It's going to get better. And you can do this thing here. Was the goal in your prototype design? Could it be as low profile as possible? Sort of flash. Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. Okay, just stop. So, there's one more damage to the... Yeah. Thank you. Right, okay. So, just to let's do pro then. We applied to a bike box recently. Okay. And then, so, height wise. I thought it was a thing. Right back there. I like to use it. She's not very high at all. This is high up. It's slightly more. Yeah. So, we have it within the... It's a bit so too thin. Okay. So, we have it within core. And so, we have project evaluation. And how do I do it? Okay. Okay, so can we close that? This is what it's going to be. So, I'm just going to have to... Yeah, that's fine. It's probably just... It's worth getting into it. Just to watch you stylish. You think I'll look more at the bottom, but in grid. Because I've seen there's lots of devices out there. Instead of taking it, you're standard and not... It's very grid. And how it sort of stylized and different concept. I think that's the thing. It's the edge. Yeah. The strip that we want to go with is what we're going to show. The look in color is cool. Yeah. I think we're going to talk about that. Okay. So, what do you want to say? Square buttons. Yeah, let me shake my key. I'm going to do that. You should shake it rather than finishing it. Okay. So, we're going to do the telephone. Okay. Okay. Right? So, at this point, we discussed... I've satisfied your order. I think that it needs more points. You're into creating things. You could like... You should think too much. Stuffy much for everything. And... It's too much. You want me to... You want me to do my design, though? I wouldn't really share what that was. Yeah. You could go for that part. I wouldn't really share what he was just using. You could. All right. So, the way this works is fun and powerful. Okay. And there's the biggest possible. I'm not counting. Shh. Let's see. Let's go over your head. It's okay. No, you need the power. Is that? It's okay. I don't need the power. I have the power. Call it. Oh, of course. There's no power. You need the power. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. So, what this is is a press to use power. I should... That is it, I set up a review on the points of discussion. From the beginning. Use that criteria to evaluate. She's for that. For the current design. It's fun. And speak and review that. I think it's going to be the financial piece. I'm not going to probably use it to change. Is it something you could do? Yeah, it could be good. And I'm going to write up our results and board. It's going to be a way for us to go through it. Decide if we're going to be the worst. Okay. So, so sort of bring together two things. Design, gold, and also the market research we had. When we rate this one is five. Six seeding. Fitting the original nine. Seven is low. Okay. At least, we've been asked to collected the rate that so we can just try and just keep work on a consensus system. We just come to an agreement. Okay. So, first one, the stylish looking field. I think that's the handy. Yeah, it's encouraging us to be able to do it pretty good. I don't know about the six. Yeah, my only reservation one is that we basically want the yellow because it's a company's color. And the yellows can really be a hit. Right. Okay. Do you guys think? I would say five is six. Okay. Yep. One time. Okay. Oh, it's actually one is seven. Oh, yeah. So, and I would say two. Three. Wait, what's the scale? One is seven. Ten. One is five. Okay, here I do. Okay. Five is six. Okay. So, high technology. Three, that's a good job. Okay, so we have to remove two of our features. We want it, but jump dial. Which is more. So, you can. I'd say it's more. Okay. Three. Okay. Okay. Star reflects fruit inspired colors. She said colors. Okay. colors and don't actually represent colors. Yeah. The yellow is more representative of color but in itself you can create those two. And design is simple in use, simple features. Yeah, really different. And I get that in your watch. Yep. Soft and spongy, which is that it is mostly very good. And so it then budgeted. And say them as possible. How do you put them? Yeah, 49 with zero being high. Pretty good. Kind of like something like that. Right. I think if you turn that into 100, it would be a tight fan. So you hurt that. So yeah, well, you have 60, 90. Oh, right. Pretty good. Okay. That was just a little fun. Maybe the third. I'm asleep. I'm calm. Is that your answer? Yeah, that's me. I didn't have one other frame. I thought I mean, I'm not knowing how we would deal with this information. I thought, okay, in theory, this kind of process that we're finding our design. It's not something pushed through, but I thought you're thinking more about dimensions. Sort of like more of three-dimensional shapes as well. So just that flat. Could I design more of a series of colors? That it's more like a line. I don't know like the harvest line and the vibrant line. Whatever. Some theme or different pounds on three. It's just discussion and the honesty we just abandoned the fun. Just thinking about what we were Yeah. Okay, great. Are you submitting the evaluation criteria for I don't know your instruction? I think they record it. I haven't been asked to see any of it. Okay. Just going to send it to the minute because it's just a very random one. I love it. Right. Well next up then because we've done the final is the project evaluation. See, I'm not missing this training corporate logo. on the vinyl track and back pussy, might be the final touch it. don't you just charge it. Do you want to just in this week that you think about about these four points and not these four points? I have no idea what this after that, I have no idea what this is. Sure. So what is it you asked me? I do not know. You are opinion on this four points and how do you... You serve our work on this? Yes. Well obviously to your system, the room is in the institution. But the main thing is, I think, I am using this space as more just to report on this supposed to be creative and constructive. You probably helped to have sort of a cumulative effect. You have ideas that come back, but the ideas are still in discussion. You know, even though this sort of center point creative was in the reality of going to this, it is not really a big more interesting thing. Do you feel that you were able to have put on creative experience? Yes, but that is just the thing is the question that comes to the first point that the room feels and creativity goes on, the need to come here and put out our ideas. I do not know what it means to do with this space. It means that you are right on that. I just looked up and said what it means to do with this space. Oh yeah. I do not know. I think it means that it means to do with this space. Yes. Okay. The question is, I would say that actually there are sort of teams of creative and ambitious who are asked to work through this, but actually the guy longs a fairly contrived. Okay. Fashion trends, if you are in vegetable color scheme, then it is always one of these. How many colors? We are talking about the things that style and feel technology, but built in 12 and a half. So actually the creativity is one and one about that. Certainly, about. Like cage, you can do whatever you like. It is very strengths. It is like a little unique. It goes so big. That is a very interesting. I do not actually let it take each point and we will be discussing it. So still on the topic of room for today. It is a bit difficult. My idea for it is quite a fun experience. At the end you have got to open up because you are not a mom. I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions and meetings. So I am also very compact in the structure. Because for brainstorming you want to show that allows you the ideas to get past. It is very evaluated to review and to keep that in mind. I guess that point about the room not being very friendly to that. I think that is a very good thing. Big fact that we are using the scripts. I feel it because I wear my glasses. But that irritates me. It does actually affect how whether you feel comfortable to communicate with people. I feel like I am hiding behind the foot. I feel it is a very comfortable set. So you are more relaxed. Not so much an attitude. That attitude is very relaxed. It is a very good foundation. And the time given of the script. Or by leadership. My sense of guidance and direction. I think that is the best. Yes, I think that is the best. I think that is the best. My first reason. Only leadership that affected leadership. Just people are saying freedom, delegation, that they have access. And they are saying that they are very honest. And they are just thoughtless. In reality, I think here the different elements of leadership. The original brief thinking of the personal coach. I think that you can get this quite a key. Quite a key in finding framework to work with. And so it is leadership. It is the point of this power. It is the number. But it is not bad leadership. It is just very strong. It turns the individual in more of that. So freedom is a method. So there may be a number of two controlling. Or I think without controlling. The interaction is very structured. And the structure is only what you see. Each individual is structured in one particular house. Rather than controlling it. And the position has been made. And it presents the track. You go around and think about it. But that process. So you have to do it in a way. And you might want to do it in a creative process. Yeah. Okay. What about two? Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Um. So I think that if we can get outside, we just could pass. You know, just like, could pass with the sports team at the club. I think the tools that they've given the tools at the Open Interest are antsy, but they don't support the energy. They support the team working together. Yeah, we're not the kids. They're still very individual. So taking upon that idea where I see this, we've had this structure in which we approach this whole pass. It's quite contrary to the principal of teamwork because the tasks with the sort of divide them. And then the work went on in isolation. I don't know what you guys did. We really did. But actually, if you imagine that you're entirely the same, ask giving to us. But first thing we have to do is come up with a design concept. And we sit here together and do it. Yeah. But that's what he gets to say that we go off and do the competition. It's actually sort of predisposing to quite contrary to teamwork. Not that we haven't done it yet. That's what we could have done. We can't. The status of it. Yeah. And what about the Hollywood youth whiteboard youth and project youth? Does anybody think that it's a really useful and appealing? I think the whiteboard for me is the kind of thing I would use all the time. But it's not quite as useful as it was to us. Could it be these things? In the sense that once we have an idea out there, a lot of work we put on between these. That could have been up on a board and opposed to text. And then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that. I know that people would just on cars and the aviation would put off. And we would just have simple like finalized prototype. And it's completely abstract and final product. But they use it as a kind of context. So we offer it and puzzle it. Very point to discuss. And the way everybody's as we discussed things in theoretically out of our notebooks. We're just, we're actually just each of us discussing something each of them up. It wasn't until we had this here. Like I once find out, peek the cross and look at the correct paper. Now I know it is deep. So that size, but the vote whiteboard could actually be this kind of thing. So do you think producing a proof of type earlier and process would have been a good idea? I think the focus of it is on PowerPoint as close to the whiteboard. Anything with that. Yeah. It's also that it will be cooler to have the whiteboard. The PowerPoint will be the whiteboard PowerPoint in the same place. Yeah. Yeah. Because the PowerPoint is providing to us probably a time pair. Whereas I can imagine if I'd be encouraged to use pink brush, for example, or whatever I would have actually used. Because that's how we want to set up to use all of that. Okay. I think that there are two new PowerPoints in this. It's like in a new PowerPoint. We spell our padding. And all our information on the PowerPoints. We don't think it's in yet. You could have gone through them. We'll do it to my side. Okay. We'll put it in. All of our digital pens to find an idea of the page. That's true. Yeah. Can't you agree? Thank you. Take a. I think you can take it before you go off. It's getting very popular. Yeah. You can take it. I think at the very start of today, I wrote a whole new stuff. Didn't click the note from one. Then went back and wrote one tiny thing. Then they clicked notes. So I'm quite worried that I actually wrote new PowerPoints. But that's not very different. I think the pen is very difficult to do. It's very difficult to do. Yeah. Pen is good. On the top of the technology, it's just a curtain. You can move our computers. It's just a curtain. Yeah. We only need one computer. We only need one computer. Yeah. There had been a fifth. They just been sitting there. And the computer may not be conducive to reading. You can't be looking to computer. You want to. And it only should be. Check some. Yeah. Yeah. It's useful. Do you think the computer is just providing distraction? I think too many computers are just distracting. I like to have things written on them. Yes, indeed. A lot of the stuff that is revealed to me, I ended up in a drive on that. So I could look out at the sleep, not have the distraction. I'm not really sure. The little ones say new ideas find. I don't know. It's a good thing about anything else. It would have been helpful. That. So. Wow. You. You want to. You want to. I think. The process. Net and the natural. Contents. Would not have been. Interrupted by this necessity. To. This. That's kind of a new idea for me is like a certain idea. What. What. What. What. What. What. What. What. Yeah. I don't know. I. I think it's quite good that we have time and it's been moving because the really could have run on. I might have been meeting with that. But the only thing is the like we've had on making a conceptual design. I thought very. Maybe another two minutes. I think maybe it's like holding on to the one room. And we just said like every hour is something everybody is actually having a short meeting. And then just. Just to have like something that's done. Just like the. My. I'm. I. I'm. Having. I'm. You. So. Including. I haven't got my five minutes to go. I think I'll do it. Five minutes to go. You get. Are the costs in budget. Yes they are. And it's. Project value. Yes it is. So. So. I. So. So. I. So. I. We're apparently not. I. One. One. Oh wow. That is. What did you tell? What did you tell? What did you tell? What did you tell? What did you tell? What did you tell? What did you tell? What did you tell? See it looks like home or city. So it's. So it's made in your hand. Councillor Delin seeing. Yeah it's just a local home. The Aaría. Aara. wooden Opuh. Yeah. But the redest. Was. What I see on cost. In happy. Fashion technology. Yeah. So you can wear home. Okay. You can slow folks. ownership. Dog. Call. I've. And slightly gathered. But will you pass themпис wh reacts거든요? Maybe she's not a real reaction to get some of that. Oh, I did it. It's a little... No, it is. It is, you've caught it. It is conceptualising. You can... It's like you said something you can put your hands on your feet and hands you have. Yeah, it's like you were playing the piano and the ideas came with play-doh. Did they? Rather than you're talking about something like that. Yeah. I'm just flinging. I don't know. Yeah, it's not something. It's not something. Yeah, it's not something. It's not something that's... The opposite. And you have to be... It's just me, it's something that you want. And so, what are your summaries and what's that? It's helpful to the breathing process. It engages all your senses. Not just your sight, but your hands are pure touch. And it's helpful to understand. I mentioned as well. I think that it's very helpful because it's such to pop up where it's on a piece of paper. And what? Even with the treating graphically, it still requires a lot of energy. Yeah, tangible. And it's handy. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Uh... Mm-hmm. Really much happiness. Yep. Are you sure? Let's go. Yeah. I'm sure it's about a baby. It's still me retreating to a higher position. I'm getting caught. You can let you get caught. Yeah, right. You can let you get caught. Yeah, right. What do you do? Um, you show that all there. Mm-hmm. You're not my foot? Yeah, yeah, I'm getting bigger. Let's see. My microphone has a TV. Oh. It's me. It's me. It's my leader. I think it's my last run out. I think it's my last run out. I think it's getting more instruction. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh yeah. All right. G Whatever Okay. you you you you

0.00-21.84 :  each system
21.84-28.84 :  Okay, I'll start meeting. Okay, we've got half an hour for this one.
28.84-32.84 :  To discuss the functional design.
32.84-36.84 :  Already the girls. Okay.
36.84-39.84 :  So hopefully, we'll be working our way.
39.84-45.84 :  And I've put the moments of the last meeting in the project.
45.84-52.84 :  So I guess just to recap on what we did last time.
52.84-59.84 :  Got to ninch of a little bit and got the new equipment and started to discuss a better
59.84-60.84 :  widely project.
60.84-63.84 :  You know, cost wise how much money you had to spend.
75.84-103.84 :  And just want to tell you that we have three new requirements.
103.84-112.84 :  And which is the first one is that the company has decided that teletext is outdated.
112.84-116.84 :  Because of popular internet is new users teletext very much anymore.
116.84-121.84 :  So we don't really need to consider that functionality of the remote control.
121.84-128.84 :  And they've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television.
128.84-130.84 :  And we see already be here.
130.84-141.84 :  And I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex, then it will affect how long it takes us to get into production the time to market.
141.84-145.84 :  So we're just going to keep it in full and it will just control the TV.
145.84-151.84 :  And the other thing was that the company wants the corporate color and slogan to be implemented in the lead sign.
151.84-154.84 :  I'm not entirely sure what the corporate color is.
154.84-157.84 :  You might be yellow.
157.84-162.84 :  And the slogan like the actual written slogan or just to embody the idea of the slogan.
162.84-164.84 :  Well, that's the thing.
164.84-166.84 :  I'm not sure.
166.84-169.84 :  Because on the company website.
169.84-171.84 :  I would just say.
171.84-173.84 :  In fashion in electron.
173.84-179.84 :  Yeah, I mean, do they start something they won't actually written like.
179.84-183.84 :  And or you just the idea that I'm not sure is that something we can discuss as well.
183.84-191.84 :  So the three things is not to worry about tell effects only control the TV and.
191.84-196.84 :  And they're incorporated the color and so on of the company.
196.84-198.84 :  So.
198.84-201.84 :  So it's okay.
201.84-203.84 :  You can.
203.84-206.84 :  But I'm trying to presentation.
206.84-209.84 :  So you'd like to go first.
209.84-211.84 :  I love it.
211.84-214.84 :  Yeah.
214.84-217.84 :  Yeah.
217.84-219.84 :  Yeah.
219.84-221.84 :  Oh, yeah.
221.84-223.84 :  Of course.
223.84-226.84 :  Yeah.
226.84-229.84 :  Yeah.
229.84-232.84 :  Yeah.
232.84-235.84 :  Yeah.
235.84-237.84 :  Yeah.
237.84-239.84 :  Yeah.
239.84-242.84 :  Yeah.
242.84-245.84 :  Yeah.
245.84-252.84 :  Yeah.
252.84-260.84 :  Yeah.
260.84-266.84 :  Yeah.
266.84-271.84 :  And I'm thinking of the.
271.84-274.84 :  I've got mine on the beach.
274.84-276.84 :  And I'm thinking of the products.
276.84-278.84 :  They see what they offer.
278.84-281.84 :  And I would like to ask you guys.
281.84-283.84 :  For your ideas.
283.84-285.84 :  and what we want to offer is anything.
285.84-287.84 :  Thank you.
287.84-290.84 :  I've really, really been existing products.
290.84-294.84 :  I found that I tend to find it to have deep themes.
294.84-296.84 :  It's a very concrete one,
296.84-298.84 :  lots of what's color, very unique.
298.84-300.84 :  You don't know what you're doing.
300.84-303.84 :  In that case, the relief impact is very bad.
303.84-305.84 :  It's an exemplar, sure, at the end.
305.84-307.84 :  So you can try to figure it out.
307.84-317.84 :  You can see it in the bottom there and there.
317.84-321.84 :  This one's called, so I found it's perp, you know, perp.
321.84-325.84 :  And don't let me tell you what it does.
325.84-337.84 :  I'm not sure if you had one together before, not the example.
337.84-339.84 :  It's a very simple one.
339.84-351.84 :  It's got a very big, not very cheap product.
351.84-357.84 :  It's very hard to access the advantage functions.
357.84-362.84 :  There's nothing for instance for a small small.
362.84-365.84 :  My own preferences, I prefer the quantity one.
365.84-367.84 :  It's very easy to use.
367.84-370.84 :  And of course it does slide the advantage functions.
370.84-373.84 :  Which I like, I like having them in the girls.
373.84-377.84 :  And I believe that the advantage functions you may be hitting the drawer.
377.84-380.84 :  I'm not sure if I can follow.
380.84-383.84 :  I have a few preferences.
383.84-387.84 :  I'm sure I've had one before.
387.84-391.84 :  I would keep a chat away for a few months or so.
391.84-393.84 :  I was just kidding.
393.84-400.84 :  Yeah, a lot of what I've read and prepared for this meeting fits me really closely with what.
400.84-406.84 :  I could give you some of my personal preferences, but I also add some of this.
406.84-410.84 :  Which is the kind of marketing.
410.84-414.84 :  Which is the kind of one.
414.84-420.84 :  Clunky in what sense, like heavier, larger.
420.84-422.84 :  I think it's just the same size.
422.84-425.84 :  But it's got much more.
425.84-428.84 :  I see as much as basic.
428.84-431.84 :  Right.
431.84-433.84 :  Yeah.
433.84-435.84 :  Sure.
435.84-437.84 :  Well, I think it's valid point.
437.84-441.84 :  I mean, like the one on the left, let's quite complicated.
441.84-445.84 :  And that theology, theology thing is incredibly convenient.
445.84-450.84 :  So I see why you might prefer a simpler design.
450.84-453.84 :  But yeah, you do want to design what it does.
453.84-456.84 :  I'm sure that's the thing I've been doing.
456.84-459.84 :  That's a good idea.
459.84-462.84 :  Do you have any functions?
462.84-464.84 :  There's one on it.
464.84-468.84 :  So far, I've got an on-off and just a channel up below.
468.84-470.84 :  One, nothing better.
470.84-472.84 :  There is the very basic security.
472.84-475.84 :  And then actual numbers for channels as well.
475.84-479.84 :  And you see that's how I acquired one or a, but what you said.
479.84-481.84 :  And then channels.
481.84-484.84 :  And then you see that.
484.84-486.84 :  I would say that's required.
486.84-489.84 :  I mean, there's no way he's going to buy over control.
489.84-491.84 :  So she can't actually into the digital channels.
491.84-493.84 :  Anybody disagree with that?
493.84-496.84 :  And what else?
496.84-499.84 :  So don't need to worry about tally text.
499.84-502.84 :  Don't need to worry about the C.R.
502.84-505.84 :  Any kind of like display controls at all.
505.84-508.84 :  You think you need to worry about it, but miss and contract.
508.84-511.84 :  So essentially what we're doing right now is we categorize.
511.84-516.84 :  And we're saying, well, we want this to be a product that offers all the tricky features.
516.84-519.84 :  But we want them to be in another area.
519.84-520.84 :  Is that right?
520.84-524.84 :  Or we're kind of like sort of, or we actually eliminate things.
524.84-526.84 :  We just don't want the product to have.
526.84-530.84 :  I think are you going to be kind of thinking what we have to have on what we're doing?
530.84-532.84 :  Just start with the end.
532.84-534.84 :  You find that exactly how to have that.
534.84-536.84 :  Not that we're going to use.
536.84-537.84 :  Okay.
537.84-538.84 :  Right.
538.84-541.84 :  Well, do you want to maybe just at this point,
541.84-545.84 :  side in what we absolutely must have as a function of it?
545.84-549.84 :  So so far, just to recap, we've got.
549.84-550.84 :  One general.
550.84-552.84 :  Right.
552.84-553.84 :  Okay.
553.84-562.84 :  Well, one one way I would look at this.
562.84-567.84 :  I think that we approach the different controls in terms of.
567.84-572.84 :  Like control types so that the user is very clear what they want to do where they go.
572.84-577.84 :  And also think maybe a little bit of what we just want to be easily accessible.
577.84-581.84 :  For example, if we had audio controls, those could be some people set up very rare.
581.84-583.84 :  Maybe they're there.
583.84-587.84 :  They're in a little area covered up.
587.84-591.84 :  Things like channel and volume.
591.84-593.84 :  Are used all the time.
593.84-596.84 :  So we just have them right out on top.
596.84-600.84 :  Very just very stuff that's fine.
600.84-603.84 :  So maybe we need to think about having.
603.84-607.84 :  Three or more groupings of controls, you know, one which are just the.
607.84-611.84 :  The habitual one should be right within your natural grip.
611.84-612.84 :  Others that are.
612.84-614.84 :  And also available.
614.84-616.84 :  Others that are concealed.
616.84-617.84 :  Okay.
617.84-618.84 :  And we're just to.
618.84-619.84 :  To.
619.84-622.84 :  And.
622.84-623.84 :  And.
623.84-624.84 :  I think maybe that.
624.84-626.84 :  And.
626.84-627.84 :  Essentially.
627.84-630.84 :  And then maybe just think it will be nice.
630.84-633.84 :  So you will be thinking like what do you say something.
633.84-634.84 :  Just like that.
634.84-635.84 :  Maybe.
635.84-637.84 :  Any.
637.84-638.84 :  Any.
638.84-639.84 :  You.
639.84-640.84 :  Yeah.
640.84-642.84 :  Okay.
642.84-643.84 :  Okay.
643.84-644.84 :  Okay.
644.84-645.84 :  Sure.
645.84-646.84 :  And.
646.84-647.84 :  And.
647.84-648.84 :  Sure.
648.84-649.84 :  And.
649.84-650.84 :  Can this.
650.84-651.84 :  Can this reach.
651.84-652.84 :  Can this plug come off?
652.84-653.84 :  So.
653.84-654.84 :  Why don't I just.
654.84-655.84 :  Pick up.
655.84-656.84 :  Yeah.
656.84-657.84 :  I just.
657.84-663.84 :  I just.
663.84-667.84 :  Yeah.
667.84-677.84 :  You.
677.84-682.84 :  Can you go behind me.
682.84-685.84 :  This is.
685.84-688.84 :  I'm not in the right place.
688.84-691.84 :  Okay.
691.84-694.84 :  Wow.
694.84-703.84 :  So I can say already, I don't know if this is for good or for bad, there'll be a lot of redundancy
703.84-707.84 :  and the issues.
707.84-709.84 :  I think, yeah.
709.84-714.84 :  It's not necessarily bad thing, but what I've already started doing is I created a slide
714.84-721.84 :  and my position has to, so that we kind of think of what's the community or the fact of
721.84-727.84 :  what we've taken from your ideas in the mind, because certainly I'm a hard time separating
727.84-729.84 :  things from things.
729.84-737.84 :  Obviously, you just told me, or you just told me impacts a lot on one, like marked research.
737.84-740.84 :  So how do I, how do you function f8?
740.84-743.84 :  Okay.
743.84-746.84 :  Okay.
746.84-749.84 :  Right.
749.84-752.84 :  So,
752.84-755.84 :  function in the blue button.
755.84-758.84 :  Oh, and you have to push it together.
758.84-764.84 :  Okay.
764.84-769.84 :  Okay.
769.84-772.84 :  Try again.
772.84-776.84 :  Again.
776.84-782.84 :  Okay.
782.84-785.84 :  Okay.
785.84-789.84 :  Just before I bring this up, what I'll just say is what I've done is try to collect some information
789.84-794.84 :  to that I can relate us to you guys that it's now becomes a collective thing.
794.84-798.84 :  And then kind of read us in the direction of deciding what our option is.
798.84-800.84 :  What should be the side?
800.84-803.84 :  You know, I mean, so.
803.84-806.84 :  Okay.
806.84-813.84 :  Okay.
813.84-816.84 :  All right.
816.84-817.84 :  Okay.
817.84-819.84 :  So that makes sense.
819.84-825.84 :  What I basically got is I just looked at this information and sort of trying to think about how we can review it.
825.84-828.84 :  Now we can want that in a decision we could take away from it.
828.84-833.84 :  And then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things, we can think about what are our priorities.
833.84-836.84 :  And certainly there's lots of different information.
836.84-843.84 :  So thinking here about primarily about customer needs that we start with the customer.
843.84-848.84 :  What they want and what are issues with existing products.
848.84-855.84 :  Think about trends and also about trying to connect that is to see what the company vision, which is about fashion and our trunks.
855.84-862.84 :  And then as this year, we'd like to prioritize our design features from this.
862.84-865.84 :  Okay.
865.84-868.84 :  So this is what I found here.
868.84-870.84 :  A lot of this to me.
870.84-874.84 :  So we'll just be two together.
874.84-877.84 :  You just dislike the looking for control.
877.84-878.84 :  So find them ugly.
878.84-881.84 :  Most people find them ugly.
881.84-885.84 :  The vast majority would spend more money for to look fancy as well.
885.84-886.84 :  We'll see later.
886.84-888.84 :  The vast majority of people would spend more money for.
888.84-894.84 :  We'll just be able to look at that in a second.
894.84-899.84 :  Most people use only a very slim portion of all the controls.
899.84-903.84 :  So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this technology.
903.84-906.84 :  They tend to use the most simple controls.
906.84-909.84 :  And overall, they find remote controls to be something they don't.
909.84-911.84 :  It doesn't really feel to them.
911.84-915.84 :  So I think what we're doing is trying to take like for me this is sort of like three different.
915.84-917.84 :  Different.
917.84-918.84 :  Inspiration.
918.84-922.84 :  So one is that we want to see that it's high tech that we want.
922.84-923.84 :  It seemed easy.
923.84-927.84 :  And in spite of the primitive side of it, from the very high tech side,
927.84-933.84 :  we want to just be in a field piece of equipment and people's head.
933.84-934.84 :  Prostrations.
934.84-939.84 :  They get lost a lot as it came up in our last meeting.
939.84-941.84 :  Takes time to learn how to use them.
941.84-944.84 :  This is why I mentioned Craig was showing us some ideas that we.
944.84-946.84 :  Actually trying group control.
946.84-949.84 :  So it doesn't just look like a big panel kind of like a need.
949.84-953.84 :  You look at, you know, a new computer keyboard or something that it's quite explanatory.
953.84-956.84 :  If you want audio, if you want visual.
956.84-959.84 :  We have those.
959.84-964.84 :  And I would admit I don't know RSI stands for.
964.84-967.84 :  Is installing.
967.84-971.84 :  No, that did not come up.
971.84-974.84 :  So here's another.
974.84-976.84 :  A review here.
976.84-979.84 :  Most people would.
979.84-982.84 :  At least we pay more voice recognition now.
982.84-985.84 :  Apparently we do have access to all the tech.
985.84-987.84 :  I think technology remote control.
987.84-989.84 :  So I don't know if that's possible.
989.84-993.84 :  We might consider getting into it.
993.84-997.84 :  And again here as we sort of move.
997.84-1000.84 :  Things are thinking about how we want to sell and market this.
1000.84-1003.84 :  I think a recurring thing here is the company wants to be.
1003.84-1005.84 :  Want us to make something special.
1005.84-1009.84 :  Well, we're trying to meet people.
1009.84-1011.84 :  Additionally are are liking the.
1011.84-1012.84 :  Here's of their products.
1012.84-1016.84 :  So we want to think about as we take all the sort of techy features.
1016.84-1017.84 :  How we can.
1017.84-1019.84 :  Put that into a unit which is.
1019.84-1020.84 :  Which people like.
1020.84-1023.84 :  They like the aesthetics and ergonomics.
1023.84-1026.84 :  So.
1026.84-1027.84 :  Yeah.
1027.84-1031.84 :  So you know just looking at what Craig.
1031.84-1034.84 :  Craig's ideas.
1034.84-1038.84 :  So tell me that we want to do is try and.
1038.84-1041.84 :  Separate the different things we want to include in this.
1041.84-1044.84 :  If we do say well we want that to be all the technology.
1044.84-1047.84 :  What we try and make that almost be like optional technology.
1047.84-1049.84 :  You know it's like.
1049.84-1051.84 :  I find a lot of TVs these days.
1051.84-1052.84 :  They're really nice.
1052.84-1055.84 :  But if you want to just turn them on and off.
1055.84-1056.84 :  They're a little panel.
1056.84-1058.84 :  Do you click and there's just like.
1058.84-1061.84 :  How many of the features you go through.
1061.84-1062.84 :  Yeah.
1062.84-1063.84 :  Yeah.
1063.84-1065.84 :  Yeah.
1065.84-1067.84 :  That's.
1067.84-1069.84 :  That's sort of.
1069.84-1070.84 :  But I.
1070.84-1073.84 :  And my hope here is that I'm putting out this information.
1073.84-1077.84 :  We can then say okay well how do we collectively move on.
1077.84-1081.84 :  I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea.
1081.84-1083.84 :  Although my sense is that what we should try and think about is.
1083.84-1087.84 :  What are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles.
1087.84-1090.84 :  And then use that but not let that.
1090.84-1091.84 :  Confine us.
1091.84-1092.84 :  Technology.
1092.84-1093.84 :  All right.
1093.84-1099.84 :  Any comments on all of that.
1099.84-1102.84 :  And one thing that we have to.
1102.84-1105.84 :  And.
1105.84-1108.84 :  These are our target.
1108.84-1110.84 :  And so.
1110.84-1112.84 :  We'll be honest with you.
1112.84-1113.84 :  There's a lot of things that.
1113.84-1114.84 :  It's good.
1114.84-1116.84 :  It's easy to use but has it was very positive.
1116.84-1117.84 :  Public Trevor.
1117.84-1118.84 :  Who do we really want to.
1118.84-1119.84 :  Okay.
1119.84-1122.84 :  Where's the money.
1122.84-1123.84 :  Yeah.
1123.84-1124.84 :  Do you have money?
1124.84-1125.84 :  Then.
1125.84-1126.84 :  What.
1126.84-1127.84 :  25 years.
1127.84-1128.84 :  25 years.
1128.84-1129.84 :  I.
1129.84-1130.84 :  Not.
1130.84-1131.84 :  Not.
1131.84-1132.84 :  Not much.
1132.84-1133.84 :  That.
1133.84-1134.84 :  But you want.
1134.84-1135.84 :  It's not going to just.
1135.84-1136.84 :  You've got the cost.
1136.84-1137.84 :  I guess.
1137.84-1138.84 :  She.
1138.84-1139.84 :  I don't.
1139.84-1140.84 :  So.
1140.84-1143.84 :  I think it'll be.
1143.84-1144.84 :  The mid-range.
1144.84-1145.84 :  The high end market.
1145.84-1146.84 :  That's.
1146.84-1147.84 :  The focus.
1147.84-1148.84 :  25.
1148.84-1149.84 :  EUR.
1149.84-1150.84 :  How much.
1150.84-1151.84 :  That.
1151.84-1153.84 :  Is that too.
1153.84-1156.84 :  Is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote.
1156.84-1157.84 :  That's my remote.
1157.84-1158.84 :  Right.
1158.84-1159.84 :  So.
1159.84-1161.84 :  Maybe not the high end.
1161.84-1162.84 :  But maybe.
1162.84-1163.84 :  Middle.
1163.84-1164.84 :  Middle.
1164.84-1165.84 :  Upish.
1165.84-1166.84 :  Kind of.
1166.84-1167.84 :  You know how much.
1167.84-1168.84 :  I don't know.
1168.84-1169.84 :  I guess you pay what.
1169.84-1170.84 :  10.
1170.84-1172.84 :  Like a simple replacement.
1172.84-1176.84 :  I mean, if you lost your remote, the first thing you want to go.
1176.84-1177.84 :  Yeah.
1177.84-1179.84 :  This kind of touches on your comments today.
1179.84-1182.84 :  But these are the age groups which we have information on.
1182.84-1183.84 :  These are.
1183.84-1186.84 :  This is a table of what people would pay more for a certain feature.
1186.84-1191.84 :  Just give us a rough idea of where the will to spend money on TV equipment is.
1191.84-1194.84 :  Mostly focused around the 25 age groups.
1194.84-1196.84 :  So you think we're.
1196.84-1197.84 :  Any.
1197.84-1198.84 :  Are you young?
1198.84-1199.84 :  Yeah.
1199.84-1200.84 :  Sort of young professional.
1200.84-1201.84 :  Yeah.
1201.84-1203.84 :  Do you think.
1203.84-1204.84 :  And.
1204.84-1211.84 :  What's recognition something you should really say.
1211.84-1219.84 :  Well, you don't say it was the adults that were.
1219.84-1220.84 :  It does.
1220.84-1221.84 :  It does fit with the market.
1221.84-1223.84 :  It's sort of identifying.
1223.84-1224.84 :  So.
1224.84-1225.84 :  I think we already have.
1225.84-1226.84 :  I said that.
1226.84-1227.84 :  Okay.
1227.84-1228.84 :  I'm getting.
1228.84-1229.84 :  Yeah.
1229.84-1230.84 :  Yeah.
1230.84-1231.84 :  Yeah.
1231.84-1232.84 :  So.
1232.84-1233.84 :  Yeah.
1233.84-1234.84 :  So.
1234.84-1235.84 :  And anybody.
1235.84-1236.84 :  Anything.
1236.84-1237.84 :  And.
1237.84-1238.84 :  Young.
1238.84-1239.84 :  Like.
1239.84-1240.84 :  We're.
1240.84-1241.84 :  I think.
1241.84-1242.84 :  I think.
1242.84-1243.84 :  I think.
1243.84-1244.84 :  I think.
1244.84-1245.84 :  I think.
1245.84-1246.84 :  I think.
1246.84-1247.84 :  I think.
1247.84-1248.84 :  I think.
1248.84-1249.84 :  I think.
1249.84-1250.84 :  25 to 35.
1250.84-1252.84 :  I think.
1252.84-1253.84 :  I think.
1253.84-1254.84 :  I think.
1254.84-1255.84 :  It's.
1255.84-1256.84 :  It's.
1256.84-1257.84 :  It's fairly.
1257.84-1258.84 :  Because.
1258.84-1259.84 :  Yeah.
1259.84-1260.84 :  That's more than half your group.
1260.84-1261.84 :  But.
1261.84-1262.84 :  At least try and use.
1262.84-1263.84 :  Yeah.
1263.84-1264.84 :  I think.
1264.84-1265.84 :  15 or 35.
1265.84-1266.84 :  30.
1266.84-1267.84 :  Yeah.
1267.84-1268.84 :  I think.
1268.84-1269.84 :  Perhaps.
1269.84-1270.84 :  I think.
1270.84-1271.84 :  Perhaps that age group.
1271.84-1272.84 :  It's.
1272.84-1273.84 :  Well.
1273.84-1274.84 :  Those are people who.
1274.84-1275.84 :  Use.
1275.84-1276.84 :  A.
1276.84-1277.84 :  Who are familiar with it.
1277.84-1278.84 :  If you're.
1278.84-1285.84 :  but now would not be so dependent on the lack of computer or mobile phone.
1285.84-1290.84 :  So these are people who are gadget or growing up used to you know in schools.
1290.84-1293.84 :  We got to do that work for us.
1293.84-1296.84 :  So it's not always so much.
1296.84-1306.84 :  So so it's a vision, actually it's such a question.
1306.84-1313.84 :  I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now.
1313.84-1318.84 :  Because based on what you everybody is saying, you want something simple.
1318.84-1321.84 :  You want basic stuff.
1321.84-1324.84 :  You want speech recognition right up to the simplest.
1324.84-1325.84 :  Right.
1325.84-1328.84 :  Somebody that you couldn't be an on-off thing.
1328.84-1335.84 :  But what I'm saying is that we're kind of lock ourselves into a particular technology rather than focusing on exactly what other people are doing.
1335.84-1341.84 :  So what are the features that we're going to say and then you know say speech recognition is good for this speech recognition.
1341.84-1342.84 :  It's not good for this.
1342.84-1345.84 :  Maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition.
1345.84-1348.84 :  It's an area that is something that can be used for field of function.
1348.84-1353.84 :  But you know the day we don't look at the technology but we'll get the function first.
1353.84-1357.84 :  So what do you want to do to see if I can get it?
1357.84-1358.84 :  Sure.
1358.84-1361.84 :  I think you can get ideas about how to do it.
1361.84-1362.84 :  Yeah.
1362.84-1365.84 :  Well, you get ideas out while they're refreshing mine.
1365.84-1366.84 :  Yeah.
1366.84-1371.84 :  So what is the first thing about speech recognition?
1371.84-1373.84 :  The first thing that we do is we make it a speech recognition.
1373.84-1378.84 :  That the community is good and maybe we're good at speech recognition.
1378.84-1379.84 :  Yeah.
1379.84-1384.84 :  I'm not losing also it helps in terms of people not losing this.
1384.84-1388.84 :  You know they're saying all it and you use it in the couch.
1388.84-1396.84 :  It's like we're kind of what we're sort of getting into here is making different design features together.
1396.84-1400.84 :  I'm going to call these teachers and let you see one in the weeks.
1400.84-1405.84 :  And they know there's enough work to get used to getting up beyond people.
1405.84-1407.84 :  I really see what we're doing.
1407.84-1411.84 :  Maybe we're not sitting up to the very end.
1412.84-1414.84 :  I'm just talking quite strange.
1414.84-1415.84 :  Yeah.
1421.84-1425.84 :  Well, this is just the working thing.
1425.84-1429.84 :  Well, this is just how I would go about it.
1429.84-1433.84 :  I guess I tried to define what we're trying to get that.
1433.84-1436.84 :  I think in a practical way, we kind of know what it is.
1436.84-1438.84 :  We used it with the middle wheel.
1438.84-1444.84 :  We have a narrow down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfill.
1444.84-1445.84 :  Designed the basics.
1445.84-1448.84 :  I think back in the back of our minds, we know what basics are.
1448.84-1449.84 :  It's a K channel.
1449.84-1450.84 :  There's two points.
1450.84-1455.84 :  But in like specifics, which one of the basics are you trying to tell me?
1455.84-1457.84 :  Are there a sort of parts of the basics that are more important?
1457.84-1459.84 :  That's important in the basics.
1459.84-1463.84 :  And I just, the idea is just to get everybody to...
1463.84-1468.84 :  I usually have a design that's as a basic.
1468.84-1471.84 :  So, you know, things that just start every single...
1471.84-1475.84 :  But I guess everybody does have some of the basic things.
1475.84-1480.84 :  Okay, this finding thing is a little bit confusing.
1480.84-1482.84 :  So I'll go to the diagram.
1482.84-1486.84 :  It just explains how the process goes through from the basic technology.
1486.84-1490.84 :  You might be the basic steps that you need in the diagram.
1490.84-1492.84 :  This slide probably works better.
1492.84-1494.84 :  Okay, you need some power source.
1494.84-1495.84 :  Get batteries.
1495.84-1497.84 :  Keep it going.
1497.84-1504.84 :  And that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last.
1504.84-1508.84 :  I mean, ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies.
1508.84-1513.84 :  How far you can transmit the thing for the complexity of the functions that you want.
1513.84-1515.84 :  Like, for example, voice recognition, right?
1515.84-1520.84 :  That might be constrained because that you might need the power microphone when you power those things.
1520.84-1525.84 :  So that's one that's constrained there.
1525.84-1530.84 :  Okay, the basic thing is, as a user interface, where people punch a button,
1530.84-1534.84 :  talk it through it, or smile through it, you can get their eyes, whatever.
1534.84-1540.84 :  And that picks up and then puts them in the user.
1540.84-1544.84 :  A series of logic is to decide what the user is telling the device.
1544.84-1548.84 :  Because the device has to, you know, based on push button A.
1548.84-1557.84 :  I will do something when you, maybe when they are able to be able to send the same power to the device itself, which is you see that there.
1557.84-1559.84 :  And I think that's it.
1559.84-1562.84 :  It's my design.
1562.84-1564.84 :  It's fairly general.
1564.84-1572.84 :  And I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking like voice recognition.
1572.84-1577.84 :  If it's something which is important, then we just add more power that having you think that you don't have power.
1577.84-1579.84 :  So it's not really constrained.
1579.84-1585.84 :  But these are functionally based function.
1585.84-1591.84 :  So I guess the rest of it, I think we should maybe you want to go back to what functions are.
1591.84-1594.84 :  I think that's more relevant to this session.
1594.84-1596.84 :  Do you do the texture?
1596.84-1598.84 :  Yeah, what I'm done.
1598.84-1600.84 :  Yeah.
1600.84-1610.84 :  Oh, it's just putting the rest of it in the words, but essentially, you have the transmitter and putting it by a logichord.
1610.84-1612.84 :  I like on the.
1612.84-1613.84 :  This is just.
1613.84-1615.84 :  It's one of the top of the technology.
1615.84-1618.84 :  Are there any like what are our options?
1618.84-1624.84 :  What's what is this the only way that we've got about it?
1624.84-1627.84 :  These aren't technology options in essence.
1627.84-1632.84 :  This is just basic principles and basic components that are needed.
1632.84-1639.84 :  For example, if you needed to add a voice recognition, right, then you use it in this.
1639.84-1645.84 :  We'll just look at that to work with the right which you have a microphone, the R.
1645.84-1650.84 :  So each component represents one function.
1650.84-1655.84 :  But I think the basic functions are logic, transmitter and the receiver.
1655.84-1659.84 :  Okay, and the power are things that you won't have to care about.
1659.84-1665.84 :  And those are things that based on what you're using, if it requires, you can add one function.
1665.84-1673.84 :  There might be one other consideration which would be the transmission between the remote control and the TV, for example.
1673.84-1675.84 :  Okay.
1675.84-1678.84 :  So you're going to restrict ourselves to using the traditional technology.
1678.84-1683.84 :  So I think because that's something you need to actually use 3.2.
1683.84-1684.84 :  Right?
1684.84-1689.84 :  Well, what I like about the rest of the new requirements is that it can make us feel complex.
1689.84-1693.84 :  It can be a fact that I don't want to get spotted.
1693.84-1700.84 :  So I think this fact might be that I used to consider our creative influence on the research.
1700.84-1703.84 :  I think it's quite a huge variety of things.
1703.84-1706.84 :  And it's right in the next two minutes.
1706.84-1709.84 :  There might be one other problem with the transmission.
1709.84-1712.84 :  In particular right now since we're talking about voice recognition.
1712.84-1717.84 :  If somebody's going to talk to the device you ideally want to use it.
1717.84-1722.84 :  You may not require that, but you know, it's something very natural, I guess.
1722.84-1727.84 :  You know, to hold it, to signal to the user, push it by the need to start talking about it.
1727.84-1730.84 :  Then you need to send the signal out.
1730.84-1733.84 :  So you see we're using infrared in the line of sight.
1733.84-1737.84 :  See the TVs at their chair, and I'm standing in front here and transferring the signal.
1737.84-1738.84 :  They're blocked.
1738.84-1741.84 :  So in that sense, there's not really a restriction.
1741.84-1745.84 :  But I think much you may have to put it later on in the first place.
1745.84-1750.84 :  And just the clarification, which is our controller.
1750.84-1758.84 :  So we have the option to be on a standard frequency is all of the other equipment.
1758.84-1759.84 :  So that one controller.
1759.84-1768.84 :  There's not much specific information, but I think that one indication of infrared means that you're just targeting traditional devices.
1768.84-1770.84 :  Because infrared is a thing.
1770.84-1773.84 :  So if you use front, it's fast.
1773.84-1775.84 :  Just so you can see.
1775.84-1778.84 :  So you know, it's only for this power.
1778.84-1784.84 :  And it's worth considering that from the start, you need that to be described as a large unit.
1784.84-1787.84 :  And you got from here.
1787.84-1792.84 :  There's, okay, from a component point of view, there's added complexity.
1792.84-1794.84 :  You add cost to it.
1794.84-1798.84 :  And then there's probably a fact that you need an other physical component.
1798.84-1800.84 :  You need docking credit.
1800.84-1802.84 :  You put it in the charge.
1802.84-1805.84 :  You need to get the user's budget.
1805.84-1811.84 :  And most users already use the value of buying batteries into your controller.
1811.84-1814.84 :  Unless the controller is going to consume a lot of batteries.
1814.84-1817.84 :  It's going to run through like 20 batteries a month.
1817.84-1820.84 :  And I don't think they charge votes for finishing.
1820.84-1821.84 :  You can move in.
1821.84-1823.84 :  Can you help out?
1823.84-1827.84 :  Right.
1827.84-1833.84 :  So this is the, I'm just going to just recap.
1833.84-1836.84 :  I'll start with it.
1836.84-1839.84 :  And the little questions to absolutely finalize.
1839.84-1841.84 :  We look at it and we've got.
1841.84-1842.84 :  Exactly.
1842.84-1846.84 :  So just to recap on.
1846.84-1849.84 :  We're all happy about the idea of.
1849.84-1852.84 :  In product.
1852.84-1854.84 :  The 50, 35.
1854.84-1864.84 :  And also the actual functions.
1864.84-1868.84 :  I think you say it's going to be a bit difficult.
1868.84-1869.84 :  On off.
1869.84-1871.84 :  Don't channel something.
1871.84-1874.84 :  And skip the channel.
1874.84-1877.84 :  And is it going to include any of the.
1877.84-1878.84 :  More events.
1878.84-1880.84 :  So we have to eliminate.
1880.84-1888.84 :  And I think we can use.
1888.84-1893.84 :  Is it is it's not an option still that we include some things as a sort of.
1893.84-1896.84 :  Under the door.
1896.84-1900.84 :  So what I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was.
1900.84-1905.84 :  Previously developed habits of expecting to control certain sound.
1905.84-1907.84 :  With their controller.
1907.84-1910.84 :  And then they.
1910.84-1913.84 :  You know, they get ours and it doesn't have that.
1913.84-1916.84 :  You know, something.
1916.84-1920.84 :  And I think that you're saying about categorizing.
1920.84-1924.84 :  Maybe I could suggest we break them down three.
1924.84-1926.84 :  One will be audio controls.
1926.84-1928.84 :  One will be video controls.
1928.84-1930.84 :  You can get on the device.
1930.84-1933.84 :  This may not match very well to.
1933.84-1935.84 :  But I think that.
1935.84-1937.84 :  From a manufacturer's point of view.
1937.84-1938.84 :  Yeah.
1938.84-1940.84 :  Designed with vice, but I think.
1940.84-1943.84 :  From a point of view of the person using it by.
1943.84-1946.84 :  You know, TV is something they see and something they hear.
1946.84-1949.84 :  And it's something they do other things to.
1949.84-1950.84 :  Right.
1950.84-1952.84 :  What we could have like three buckets.
1952.84-1953.84 :  We could throw some.
1953.84-1954.84 :  Like.
1954.84-1955.84 :  Yeah.
1955.84-1956.84 :  Yeah.
1956.84-1958.84 :  And then from there, the side is basic.
1958.84-1959.84 :  This is.
1959.84-1962.84 :  And I think that.
1962.84-1964.84 :  I think that.
1964.84-1965.84 :  It might help.
1965.84-1966.84 :  The visual.
1966.84-1967.84 :  And it would actually help.
1967.84-1968.84 :  With the.
1968.84-1969.84 :  But.
1969.84-1971.84 :  Okay.
1971.84-1972.84 :  Okay.
1972.84-1973.84 :  Okay.
1973.84-1974.84 :  Okay.
1974.84-1975.84 :  Okay.
1975.84-1976.84 :  I'm.
1976.84-1977.84 :  I'm.
1977.84-1978.84 :  I'm.
1978.84-1979.84 :  I'm.
1979.84-1980.84 :  I'm.
1980.84-1981.84 :  I'm.
1981.84-1982.84 :  I'm.
1982.84-1983.84 :  And.
1983.84-1984.84 :  I'm.
1984.84-1985.84 :  I'm.
1985.84-1986.84 :  I'm.
1986.84-1987.84 :  I'm.
1987.84-1994.84 :  I'm.
1994.84-2000.84 :  You know,
2000.84-2006.84 :  I do.
2006.84-2009.84 :  Just.
2009.84-2011.84 :  So.
2011.84-2018.84 :  And I'm just just to ask not to go out and ask you a question.
2018.84-2024.84 :  And start with the question.
2024.84-2028.08 :  Yeah, just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up,
2028.08-2033.44 :  should we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we resume
2033.44-2035.32 :  that we'll use this idea, games,
2035.32-2037.84 :  proposal, we think these two sort of buttons.
2037.84-2040.52 :  Anything we discuss about them is sort of,
2040.52-2041.52 :  okay, we're talking about this.
2041.52-2042.52 :  Should we do that?
2042.52-2043.52 :  Yeah.
2043.52-2044.52 :  Okay.
2044.52-2045.52 :  Just about the,
2045.52-2046.52 :  about some ongoing,
2046.52-2048.52 :  the device group,
2048.52-2050.52 :  things like on-off,
2050.52-2053.52 :  because they don't have anything to do with what you see.
2053.52-2057.52 :  I mean, in terms of picture and entertainment value.
2057.52-2059.52 :  You know, so,
2059.52-2060.52 :  in channel.
2060.52-2061.52 :  In channel.
2061.52-2064.52 :  Because the on-off also goes,
2064.52-2065.52 :  you know, on-off,
2065.52-2066.52 :  like how, not on-off sound,
2066.52-2068.52 :  or on-off video.
2069.52-2071.52 :  You know, on your TV,
2071.52-2073.52 :  but you might want to, you know, turn off the sound,
2073.52-2075.52 :  say you want to pick up for the mute button.
2075.52-2080.52 :  So, you have, you have a choice to put it on to others,
2080.52-2082.52 :  or a device.
2082.52-2083.52 :  Device, basically,
2083.52-2085.52 :  anything which we can't categorize.
2085.52-2086.52 :  Anything you have,
2086.52-2087.52 :  or you,
2087.52-2088.52 :  just like,
2088.52-2089.52 :  just like,
2089.52-2090.52 :  something,
2090.52-2091.52 :  something.
2091.52-2092.52 :  Anything to do with what you hear,
2092.52-2094.52 :  or you put that into others.
2094.52-2097.52 :  And the video is anything that you can see.
2097.52-2099.52 :  This is right.
2099.52-2100.52 :  Yeah.
2100.52-2101.52 :  And then,
2101.52-2102.52 :  actually,
2102.52-2103.52 :  like,
2103.52-2105.52 :  something that you want to share.
2105.52-2106.52 :  Okay.
2106.52-2108.52 :  And then,
2108.52-2110.52 :  I suppose quite likely what happened is,
2110.52-2111.52 :  you know, the device category,
2111.52-2112.52 :  there might be some of them,
2112.52-2113.52 :  just like,
2113.52-2114.52 :  a bit slow,
2114.52-2115.52 :  standard,
2115.52-2116.52 :  and others which are maybe,
2116.52-2117.52 :  like random,
2117.52-2118.52 :  which we have,
2118.52-2119.52 :  rather, they push it up.
2119.52-2120.52 :  We needed some of them.
2120.52-2121.52 :  Even,
2121.52-2122.52 :  even if it doesn't matter,
2122.52-2124.52 :  clearly what happens is that people at least have some,
2124.52-2125.52 :  you know, mine,
2125.52-2126.52 :  it's easy to use.
2126.52-2128.52 :  I think that's what we're doing.
2128.52-2130.52 :  And I guess from the corner part,
2130.52-2131.52 :  you see,
2131.52-2132.52 :  you need to do as well,
2132.52-2133.52 :  because it's like,
2133.52-2134.52 :  based on,
2134.52-2135.52 :  okay.
2135.52-2136.52 :  So, yeah,
2136.52-2137.52 :  yes.
2137.52-2138.52 :  But,
2138.52-2139.52 :  I'm going to look at it
2139.52-2140.52 :  because if we were,
2140.52-2141.52 :  we're,
2141.52-2142.52 :  you know,
2142.52-2143.52 :  starting with that,
2143.52-2144.52 :  something that you can,
2144.52-2145.52 :  correct,
2145.52-2146.52 :  but,
2146.52-2147.52 :  you know,
2147.52-2148.52 :  it's like,
2148.52-2149.52 :  it's like,
2149.52-2150.52 :  it's like,
2150.52-2151.52 :  it's like,
2151.52-2152.52 :  it's like,
2152.52-2153.52 :  it's like,
2153.52-2154.52 :  it's like,
2154.52-2155.52 :  it's like,
2156.52-2157.52 :  it's like,
2157.52-2158.52 :  it's like,
2158.52-2159.52 :  it's like,
2159.52-2160.52 :  it's like,
2160.52-2161.52 :  it's like,
2161.52-2162.52 :  it's like,
2162.52-2163.52 :  it's like,
2163.52-2164.52 :  yeah.
2164.52-2165.52 :  And we need to go and find out
2165.52-2167.52 :  what we picked up the lunch today.
2167.52-2170.52 :  Yeah.
2170.52-2174.90 :  We can see that they are super smokey.
2174.90-2194.38 :  Don't let it take a moment of light to shut down each and every remaining person
2194.38-2198.94 :  is comfortable Let it go.
2198.94-2200.94 :  you
2228.94-2230.94 :  you
2258.94-2260.94 :  you

0.00-2.00 :  well Büro�.
5.00-6.00 :  Thank you.
6.00-7.00 :  Quality.
7.00-8.00 :  Produced?
8.00-10.44 :  I think it's already inside.
15.36-22.30 :  I'm gonna sign that 거야.
22.30-28.32 :  I think we have that size of idea where we're going to move and
28.32-47.94 : 援
47.94-49.94 :  Yes, I do.
49.94-51.94 :  Okay.
55.94-59.94 :  Well, that's the key point for our project.
61.94-67.94 :  And this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes.
67.94-71.94 :  So first of all, make sure that you don't need others.
71.94-73.94 :  I'm Laura and I'm a project manager.
73.94-75.94 :  Nice.
75.94-77.94 :  Can you introduce yourself today?
77.94-79.94 :  Hi, I'm David and I'm supposed to be in the district.
79.94-81.94 :  Okay.
81.94-85.94 :  I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert.
85.94-87.94 :  I'm David and I'm his employee.
87.94-89.94 :  Okay.
89.94-91.94 :  Okay.
91.94-93.94 :  So we're designing a new remote control.
93.94-97.94 :  And I have to record a piece here too.
97.94-101.94 :  So it's David, I'm James Craig.
101.94-107.94 :  And you arrive, don't you?
107.94-111.94 :  Yes, we're designing a new remote control.
111.94-115.94 :  It's a piece that's for your original trendier.
115.94-119.94 :  That's kind of our break.
119.94-121.94 :  We're live.
121.94-125.94 :  And so there are three different stages to the design.
125.94-129.94 :  I'm not sure what will be guys' ability to see each.
129.94-131.94 :  I'm going to ask you to do that.
131.94-135.94 :  You just got the project in that seat.
135.94-137.94 :  Okay.
137.94-139.94 :  Yeah.
139.94-141.94 :  Sorry, the video doubts.
141.94-143.94 :  Okay.
143.94-153.94 :  So we're going to have individual work in a meeting by the repeat process three times.
153.94-157.94 :  And this is when you get to try out the white voice over there.
157.94-165.94 :  So get your favorite animal and sum up the pivot path.
165.94-167.94 :  So here that's the way.
167.94-175.94 :  All right.
175.94-180.94 :  So.
180.94-185.94 :  This one here, right?
185.94-187.94 :  All right.
187.94-195.94 :  Favorite animal.
195.94-212.94 :  How big of a girl.
212.94-214.94 :  Is that right?
214.94-216.94 :  Yeah.
216.94-222.94 :  I'm probably pretty pretty old.
222.94-228.94 :  You're willing to take a lot of physical affection.
228.94-234.94 :  And they have lots of personality.
234.94-236.94 :  You fit and robust.
236.94-238.94 :  Good.
238.94-240.94 :  That's good.
240.94-244.94 :  That one's bigger.
244.94-254.94 :  That one's bigger.
254.94-264.94 :  I'm going to be a monkey.
264.94-268.94 :  And then the smoke.
268.94-270.94 :  Sorry.
270.94-272.94 :  One plant.
272.94-274.94 :  Come real.
274.94-278.94 :  I'm going to be up there.
278.94-288.94 :  I'm going to be up there.
288.94-292.94 :  You can take as long as it is you like.
292.94-294.94 :  We do.
294.94-298.94 :  Don't feel like you're in a rush.
298.94-306.94 :  I could talk to a lot more about the.
306.94-312.94 :  I'm going to be up there.
312.94-316.94 :  Impressionist.
316.94-320.94 :  Is that a wheel?
320.94-322.94 :  Yeah.
322.94-324.94 :  Well, I don't know.
324.94-328.94 :  It's just the first animal I think off the top of my head.
328.94-332.94 :  It's big reason is because I'm allergic to most animal.
332.94-342.94 :  I'm allergic to my own.
342.94-346.94 :  I'm allergic to my own.
346.94-350.94 :  Yeah.
350.94-354.94 :  I'm allergic to my own.
354.94-358.94 :  I'm allergic to the dog as well.
358.94-362.94 :  I'm allergic to the animal.
362.94-366.94 :  It's my dog.
366.94-372.94 :  I don't know.
372.94-378.94 :  It's my dog.
378.94-382.94 :  I see a dog in there.
382.94-392.94 :  I see a rooster.
392.94-394.94 :  Kindness.
394.94-398.94 :  And he's a mixture of the various things.
398.94-402.94 :  What thread I put him.
402.94-404.94 :  That's the tip of the tip of the tool.
404.94-408.94 :  And he's very friendly and teary and always used to see you.
408.94-416.94 :  And very kind of affectionate.
416.94-418.94 :  And he's quite wee as well.
418.94-426.94 :  So he doesn't take up too much space.
426.94-430.94 :  And he does a funnier tip to.
430.94-432.94 :  Is he aware that this is on check?
432.94-434.94 :  No, he's just.
434.94-436.94 :  He does a happy thing.
436.94-440.94 :  And it's always fun to get up and start chasing him.
440.94-442.94 :  It's on him.
442.94-444.94 :  Not a good adult.
444.94-448.94 :  Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention for doing it.
448.94-450.94 :  It's very good condition.
450.94-454.94 :  Where does he find his just on here?
454.94-458.94 :  Okay.
458.94-462.94 :  Are you doing this?
462.94-464.94 :  Okay.
464.94-466.94 :  Okay.
466.94-472.94 :  I need to discuss the content.
472.94-476.94 :  So according to the break, we're going to be selling this.
476.94-478.94 :  We're looking for this 25 year of.
478.94-482.94 :  And we're in need to make 50 million here.
482.94-486.94 :  And so we're going to be selling this on an international scale.
486.94-491.94 :  And we don't want it to cost anymore than 1250 years.
491.94-495.94 :  So we're going to be selling this.
495.94-497.94 :  50% to the 7.
497.94-499.94 :  Can we just go over that again?
499.94-501.94 :  Sure.
501.94-503.94 :  So this.
503.94-507.94 :  So cost like production cost is.
507.94-509.94 :  All together.
509.94-513.94 :  1250 but selling price is that wholesale or retail.
513.94-515.94 :  Like on the shelf.
515.94-517.94 :  I don't know.
517.94-519.94 :  I imagine that's a good thing.
519.94-521.94 :  I think the problem is wholesale.
521.94-523.94 :  It's a good thing.
523.94-525.94 :  The retail.
525.94-531.94 :  To sell it for the price I want.
531.94-533.94 :  But I don't know.
533.94-537.94 :  I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally.
537.94-539.94 :  How do you design it?
539.94-541.94 :  Yes.
541.94-547.94 :  I think it will.
547.94-553.94 :  Right away I'm wondering if there's like the DVD players there are zones.
553.94-555.94 :  Oh yeah.
555.94-557.94 :  Frequency.
557.94-559.94 :  Yeah.
559.94-561.94 :  As well as characters.
561.94-563.94 :  Different.
563.94-565.94 :  Keep ads styles.
565.94-567.94 :  Yeah.
567.94-569.94 :  But for our controllers you can probably be.
569.94-571.94 :  That's because it's a lot complicated.
571.94-573.94 :  It does make sense.
573.94-575.94 :  Well, you could design a lot of you because.
575.94-577.94 :  Yes.
577.94-579.94 :  More complicated.
579.94-581.94 :  Yeah.
581.94-583.94 :  Yeah.
583.94-585.94 :  And then and then the other thing in the national.
585.94-587.94 :  On top of the price.
587.94-590.94 :  Thinking.
590.94-595.94 :  The price might might appeal to a certain market in one region.
595.94-597.94 :  Where is another.
597.94-601.94 :  Just to care just to care for us.
601.94-605.94 :  Or just like basic product for the position.
605.94-607.94 :  25 euro.
607.94-613.94 :  I'm not controlling my big head and London might not be such a big head.
613.94-615.94 :  Greece.
615.94-618.94 :  Yeah.
618.94-620.94 :  Martin.
620.94-624.94 :  I should be right on the stone.
631.94-655.94 :  Right away.
655.94-665.94 :  So I'm wondering.
665.94-669.94 :  I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here.
669.94-673.94 :  Okay, trendy probably means something other than just basic.
673.94-674.94 :  Yeah.
674.94-675.94 :  Something other than just.
675.94-677.94 :  Standard.
677.94-681.94 :  So I'm wondering right away is selling 25 years is that sort of.
681.94-685.94 :  I mean, that's about like 18.
685.94-691.94 :  16 17 18.
691.94-693.94 :  Yeah.
693.94-695.94 :  I don't know how to make photo.
695.94-696.94 :  I know.
696.94-698.94 :  I get a lot of you.
698.94-700.94 :  We got you.
700.94-702.94 :  Yeah.
702.94-708.94 :  Yeah.
708.94-711.94 :  Yeah.
711.94-714.94 :  Okay.
714.94-719.94 :  Does anybody have anything to add to.
719.94-722.94 :  To the financial issue.
722.94-725.94 :  Do you have any other back.
725.94-729.94 :  No, actually, that would be useful.
729.94-753.94 :  Can you like what your money would get you.
753.94-767.94 :  Yeah, interesting thing about discussing the production of remote control for me is that as you point out, I just don't think the month control is being something something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits.
767.94-775.94 :  It's just like getting shoelaces and shoes.
775.94-777.94 :  So you know, I mean like.
777.94-778.94 :  Yeah.
778.94-779.94 :  So like how do you.
779.94-781.94 :  I mean, one way look at it.
781.94-786.94 :  Well, the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy remote control.
786.94-791.94 :  Or the way maybe people have TV sets really set up with their remote control.
791.94-799.94 :  I really want better one.
799.94-800.94 :  Right.
800.94-801.94 :  Right.
801.94-810.94 :  So in function, one of the priorities would be to combine the uses.
810.94-811.94 :  Right.
811.94-816.94 :  So do you think that should be like a man's line in the fire.
816.94-819.94 :  You're like your telling me.
819.94-824.94 :  Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of example of successful.
824.94-835.94 :  But if these technology is palm, palm pilots, they're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras and the two players, pal phones, everything agenda.
835.94-843.94 :  So like I wonder if we might add some new to the remote control markets, such as the lighting in your house or.
843.94-845.94 :  For the night you need to buy.
845.94-847.94 :  And what you want to watch.
847.94-848.94 :  Like you might.
848.94-852.94 :  I don't think it's an extra functionality.
852.94-853.94 :  Yeah.
853.94-862.94 :  Like personally for me at home, I've combined the audio video television set in my DVD player CD player.
862.94-866.94 :  So they all work actually function together, but I have different remote controls.
866.94-873.94 :  So it's sort of ironic that they're.
873.94-874.94 :  You know, sound.
874.94-875.94 :  This is one system.
875.94-884.94 :  Each one's got its own.
884.94-885.94 :  Okay.
885.94-892.94 :  I'm going to have to wrap up pretty quickly.
892.94-894.94 :  So anything else in the.
894.94-904.94 :  And what they do.
904.94-905.94 :  Okay.
905.94-909.94 :  I need to see if I saw.
909.94-912.94 :  Or you want to.
912.94-913.94 :  Yeah.
913.94-914.94 :  Yeah.
914.94-915.94 :  Yeah.
915.94-916.94 :  Yeah.
916.94-917.94 :  Yeah.
917.94-918.94 :  Yeah.
918.94-919.94 :  Yeah.
919.94-920.94 :  Yeah.
920.94-921.94 :  Yeah.
921.94-922.94 :  Yeah.
922.94-923.94 :  Yeah.
923.94-924.94 :  Yeah.
924.94-925.94 :  Yeah.
925.94-926.94 :  Yeah.
926.94-927.94 :  Yeah.
927.94-931.94 :  I remember when the first remote control my, my family had was on a cable.
931.94-935.94 :  Actually the cable TV and big like buttons that sort of.
935.94-936.94 :  On the blender.
936.94-937.94 :  Right.
937.94-939.94 :  And you know, I think about what they are now.
939.94-943.94 :  It's better, but actually it's still kind of.
943.94-945.94 :  And massive junky thing.
945.94-947.94 :  And we could think about how.
947.94-948.94 :  It could be more.
948.94-950.94 :  You know, stream on.
950.94-952.94 :  Like something like that.
952.94-954.94 :  Or whatever would be.
954.94-955.94 :  I can watch the.
955.94-956.94 :  Okay.
956.94-957.94 :  It could be that.
957.94-958.94 :  It could be that.
958.94-959.94 :  It could be that.
959.94-960.94 :  It could be that.
960.94-962.94 :  Functionally that doesn't make it better.
962.94-963.94 :  Just the appeal.
963.94-964.94 :  I'm not having.
964.94-965.94 :  You know, these days it's really.
965.94-967.94 :  Things that people's homes are becoming more and more like.
967.94-968.94 :  She.
968.94-969.94 :  Yeah.
969.94-970.94 :  Nice material.
970.94-971.94 :  Okay.
971.94-972.94 :  Might be.
972.94-973.94 :  Yeah.
973.94-974.94 :  Yeah.
974.94-975.94 :  We were exploring.
975.94-976.94 :  Right.
976.94-981.94 :  Well, so it is to wrap up the next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes.
981.94-982.94 :  So that's about.
982.94-984.94 :  About 10 to 12 months.
984.94-988.94 :  And so in between nine then.
988.94-992.94 :  As the investor with signer, you're going to be working on.
992.94-993.94 :  Yeah.
993.94-1000.94 :  For user interface technical functions.
1000.94-1006.94 :  And so it's.
1006.94-1007.94 :  Yes.
1007.94-1008.94 :  I guess that's.
1008.94-1009.94 :  What.
1009.94-1010.94 :  What I actually.
1010.94-1011.94 :  And.
1011.94-1012.94 :  And.
1012.94-1013.94 :  And.
1013.94-1014.94 :  And.
1014.94-1015.94 :  And.
1015.94-1016.94 :  You'll be.
1016.94-1017.94 :  Just thinking about what it actually.
1017.94-1018.94 :  You know what requirements.
1018.94-1019.94 :  It has to.
1019.94-1020.94 :  Has to fulfill.
1020.94-1021.94 :  And you know, get instructions.
1021.94-1022.94 :  Even.
1022.94-1023.94 :  Yes.
1023.94-1024.94 :  Okay.
1024.94-1025.94 :  Yeah.
1025.94-1026.94 :  Yeah.
1026.94-1033.94 :  So it's the functional design stage of next.
1033.94-1034.94 :  And.
1034.94-1035.94 :  And.
1035.94-1036.94 :  And.
1036.94-1037.94 :  And.
1037.94-1039.94 :  I got a little message.
1039.94-1041.94 :  A lot of seniors might.
1041.94-1046.94 :  I would.
1046.94-1050.94 :  Before we wrap up just to make sure we're all in same page.
1050.94-1052.94 :  Do we.
1052.94-1055.94 :  We're given sort of an example of a coffee.
1055.94-1056.94 :  She.
1056.94-1057.94 :  Well.
1057.94-1060.94 :  And.
1060.94-1061.94 :  Are we.
1061.94-1064.94 :  Right now in the assumption that our television remote control.
1064.94-1065.94 :  May feature.
1065.94-1067.94 :  Go beyond television.
1067.94-1069.94 :  Or are we keeping sort of like a.
1069.94-1070.94 :  Design.
1070.94-1071.94 :  To.
1071.94-1073.94 :  Television features.
1073.94-1074.94 :  Okay.
1074.94-1075.94 :  Well, just very confused.
1075.94-1077.94 :  Who's supposed to finish.
1077.94-1078.94 :  And.

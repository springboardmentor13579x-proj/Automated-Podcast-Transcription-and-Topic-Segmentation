[0.81-4.92] we will hear arguments this morning and case twenty four twelve eighty seven learning
[4.92-9.57] resources vs trump and the consolidated case general sour
[12.45-14.31] mister chief justice it may it please the court
[15.24-19.50] on april second president trump determined that are exploding trade deficit have brought us
[19.50-24.48] to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe he further pronounce that
[24.48-29.07] that traffic offense know another opioids into our country has created a public health
[29.07-32.13] crisis taking hundreds of thousands of american lives
[33.21-37.50] president trump has declared that these emergencies our country killing and not sustainable that
[37.50-41.58] they threaten the bedrock of our national economic security and that fixing them will
[41.58-45.36] make america strong financially viable and respected country again
[46.83-50.64] due to are you but terrorists president trump has negotiated agreements were trillions of
[50.64-56.64] dollars with major trading partners including most recently china unwinding those agreements he warns
[56.64-61.26] would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive
[61.26-65.88] america from strength to failure with ruined his economic at national security consequences
[68.49-72.06] in games and morgan's reagan this court held that a heap a sweeping and
[72.07-77.37] unqualified language grants the president's actions the strongest presumption of validity and the widest
[77.37-79.11] latitude of traditional interpretation
[80.01-83.97] yet plaintiffs argue that terrorists are you a buzz least on most nimble to
[83.97-87.84] all are virtually the only tool that congress did not great the president to
[87.84-89.31] deal with for and emergencies
[90.63-95.64] that is wrong the phrase regular importation plainly embraces tariffs which are among the
[95.64-100.29] most traditional in direct methods of regulating importation employees can see that are you
[100.29-102.96] bill authorizes quotas another tier of equivalence
[104.40-108.72] the major questions doctrine does not apply here are you can first major powers
[108.72-112.50] to address major problems on the president who is perhaps the most major actor
[112.50-114.33] in the realm of foreign affairs
[115.14-118.74] in the non delegation doctor in cash no doubt on our iba because congress
[118.74-122.79] may a the president broad authority regarding the conduct of foreign affairs or he
[122.79-127.29] enjoys his own inherent article to powers i welcome the courts questions
[128.97-135.18] reduce than the few minutes on why exactly the major question doctrine and apply
[135.19-139.74] to the present in this case yes justice thomas i i make two or
[139.74-141.93] three points on that front first of all
[142.74-146.46] though major questions doctrine may apply to the press and other contact specifically in
[146.46-151.05] the foreign affairs contacts or he has his own inherent article to authority it's
[151.05-153.93] a particularly poor fit to apply the major questions doctor and that's where at
[153.93-156.78] least two reasons first of all just as a matter of kind of common
[156.78-162.36] sense interpretation one would expect congress to confer major powers on the president to
[162.36-167.22] address major you know sort of foreign international crises so to speak a foreign
[167.22-171.60] arising emergencies that just sort of a national common sense than you expect congress
[171.60-174.99] to do it in fact you're just as jackson and is youngstown opinion address
[174.99-178.17] this very situation and pages six have to do at six sixty three when
[178.17-181.43] he says this is the system within our or this is the procedure within
[181.43-185.55] in our constitutional system that we have developed to strike a balance you know
[185.61-189.54] what what games and more described as that never ending tension between in the
[189.54-193.35] the need for the executive to address it ever repost power to dress emergencies
[193.35-198.39] and just subjected to checks and balances what our constitution has devised to address
[198.39-202.43] that particular problem that never any intention is the system where congress can first
[202.43-206.70] brought imaginary powers and in advance in subjects them to ongoing political oversight which
[206.70-209.73] is accurate you see and i iba so that's one reason one researchers estimate
[209.73-215.10] or commonsense interpretation you would expect congress to grant major powers to the president
[215.25-219.66] who has his own broader range of major authority article in aeronautical to authority
[219.66-222.87] in this context and that has been just you're able to just general there
[222.87-225.84] and i know that you have a second question and i want to let
[225.84-229.68] you get to that but just on that first reason it seem to depend
[229.68-234.63] a lot on the president's in here and article to powers and i'm wondering
[234.63-240.66] what exactly which which powers you're speaking of their because tariffs one would naturally
[240.66-247.26] think is a or their power to impose taxes the power to regulate foreign
[247.26-251.46] commerce these are not things that are i thought of this article to powers
[251.49-257.13] they are quintessential article one powers so what kind of article to powers are
[257.13-262.29] you relying on when you gave the answer about major questions to justice thomas
[262.68-265.71] i would refer to what the court said for example and egan department maybe
[265.71-270.27] it's even that's generally accepted view that the president has broad authority in the
[270.27-273.87] foreign affairs round debates about exactly how far it goes and how to draw
[273.87-278.40] the boundary between the president congress but he didn't get many other cases kurdish
[278.40-281.73] right the court has recognized the president has brought in here to thirty two
[281.73-287.28] address for in situations foreign affairs foreign policy including for the rising emergencies now
[287.28-291.18] we don't contend that he has he has at least in peacetime inherit terrifying
[291.18-295.29] authority what we have here is two layers there's the layer the bedrock of
[295.29-298.65] the president's you know inherent article to powers and layered on top of that
[298.65-300.00] is a sweeping delegation
[300.07-305.21] and of of authority from congress we put those two things together congress is
[305.21-308.82] say you have inherent power to address your national emergencies and working for new
[308.85-312.39] on you the tools including article one tools like for example the power to
[312.39-316.14] regulate for congress i want like a very important distinction you we don't contend
[316.14-320.25] that what's be exercised here the power to tax it's the power to regulate
[320.25-324.94] foreign commerce these a regulatory terrorists they are not revenue raising tears the fact
[324.94-328.56] that they raise revenue was only incidental the terrorists would be most effective so
[328.56-332.31] to speak if no no no person ever paid that they they achieve their
[332.31-337.47] goals of they have council you you've already mentioned games and more three three
[337.47-341.70] times which surprises me a little because the court in games and more when
[341.74-345.30] out of its way to say that it was issuing a very narrow decision
[345.54-349.86] and pretty much expected to apply only in this case just a few quotes
[349.86-355.02] it said decisions in this area had been rare episodic and afford little presidential
[355.02-357.21] value for subs subsequent cases
[358.20-363.45] again we lay down know general guidelines covering other situations not involved here and
[363.63-367.89] find the opinion only to the very questions necessary to decision of this case
[368.82-372.81] and end of the opinions had finally we we emphasize the narrowness of our
[372.81-374.31] decision now
[376.68-380.58] this issue and games and more with different provision of value but not at
[380.58-381.18] issue here
[381.99-386.10] and certainly did not concerned tariffs so i don't quite understand how you can
[386.10-389.28] get as much out of dames is games and more you're trying to get
[390.15-393.24] maybe i heard this we don't dispute the james more is as you stated
[393.24-397.71] narrow opinion however it it it it it address certain principles that we think
[397.74-401.88] are equally applicable here for example to interpret it principal dames and more held
[401.88-404.37] and again it was it was a power to nullify and void not the
[404.37-407.37] power to regulate but it's in the very same sense in the very same
[407.37-410.73] statute and the court quoted the first circuit opinions that look this a sweeping
[410.73-415.11] i'm qualified language which it didn't disagree with a and then of said this
[415.11-419.61] particular provision were congress has given these broad verbs i mean regulated capacious verb
[419.61-422.97] admittedly so our nullifies or avoid so our front the all the other verbs
[422.97-426.48] that area in a language iba the way the core thought about as we're
[426.48-430.32] looking at this through the lens of justice jackson's opinion youngstown in the court
[430.32-436.14] held specifically that these verbs place the president in youngstown zone one the court
[436.14-440.73] held that that he's subject subject to the widest latitude of judicial interpretation that
[440.73-442.92] he received ounces strongest presumption of validity
[444.12-445.95] i just don't understand this argument
[447.33-452.70] it's not an article it's a congressional power not a presidential power to attacks
[453.24-456.78] and you want to see terrorists are not taxes but that's exactly what they
[456.78-463.77] are degenerating money from american citizens revenue you say it's incidental to the regulatory
[463.77-464.55] purpose
[465.75-471.96] but i don't see how a quota is equivalent to revenue raising a quota
[472.38-477.03] sets a limit to what you can import in but it doesn't generate revenue
[478.41-485.22] i don't understand this argument that it's equivalent or that foreign powers or even
[485.22-486.21] an emergency
[487.17-490.47] can do away with the nature questions doctrine
[491.52-496.59] didn't we in the biden case recently say an emergency can't make clear what's
[496.65-497.37] ambiguous
[498.99-500.40] as to that point i believe
[502.11-505.68] the court is never apply that major questions doctrine in a foreign policy cause
[505.74-510.45] we have our gotta not warrant and so we have never applied it to
[510.45-514.70] foreign affairs but this is a tariff sis attacks it is a it is
[514.71-519.32] a if i may it's a foreign facing regulation of foreign commerce that's kind
[519.32-523.95] of torn on earth is everything looks so biden could have declared a national
[523.95-525.93] emergency and global warming
[526.74-529.59] and then gotten his student forgiveness
[531.15-535.32] to not be a major questions after i don't think it could have gotten
[535.32-539.40] student loan forgiveness i what a little bit of it's cool it's foreign and
[539.40-541.32] facing we need
[542.55-545.01] we need all of these things to
[546.09-547.05] to face
[550.47-554.79] to tax fossil fuel or to do something else that's all biden would have
[554.79-558.63] had to do with any of these programs wouldn't put it this way if
[558.63-562.92] i may is just to clear some form facing purpose
[563.82-568.74] if i made a make like articulate this way the power to impose tariffs
[568.92-573.30] is a core application of the power to regulate foreign commerce which is what
[573.30-577.83] the phrase regular importation and i even naturally evokes wonder how long it's could
[577.83-581.67] you tell me why it is that when congress intended
[582.66-588.99] to permit a president to regulate by imposing tariffs it's always use tariff and
[588.99-595.92] regularly of about sixteen laws in the pass that when congress intended regulate mean
[595.92-599.25] taxing that use texas simultaneous
[601.53-604.65] there's a little didn't hear respect with this court came to the opposite conclusion
[604.65-607.98] if i may in the algonquin were of the phrase would not and world
[607.98-612.99] moves that was we did something in algonquin it was in the duty section
[614.01-616.59] so unlike here it was
[618.30-625.38] paired with questions about decreasing tariffs and increasing tariffs
[626.79-632.04] so it's just a very different statue than one it at issue here but
[632.04-635.85] the governing language admittedly the references to judaism section two thirty two a to
[635.85-638.37] thirty two see is not refer to them and the court didn't refer to
[638.37-641.78] talk to a or the right races duties are terrorists analysis what it held
[641.78-645.99] was the race adjust imports which includes a verb that's narrower but it was
[645.99-650.16] i to learn to actually encourage it was in context of activities that had
[650.16-657.09] to do with raising and lowering duties hear the now the verbs that accompany
[657.09-663.45] regulate have nothing to do with racing revenues in the form of texas and
[663.45-668.01] council algonquin wasn't a texture list opinion do you would agree with that in
[668.01-672.27] other words the analysis that the court was using their was really keen to
[672.27-676.38] the legislative history of that statute and it wasn't is that we were doing
[676.38-680.43] and interpretation at the word adjust i disagree without i think you read the
[680.43-683.76] opinion first or talks about plain meaning than it talks about stashed contacts of
[683.76-687.00] that it goes onto legislative history so it was all three of those and
[687.00-691.74] the conclusion it came to it it it directly addressing rejected the argument that
[691.74-694.98] the dc circuit have accepted in that case which is that when congress wants
[694.98-698.70] a delegate the authority to tear up at use a consistently explicit and well
[698.70-702.36] defined approach we just use these magic words tear of tax imposed in so
[702.63-706.17] let me for my know we got a the congress is not bound to
[706.17-710.10] use that particular formulation what it wants to confer his power let me ask
[710.10-710.97] you about
[711.90-715.86] the premise of your argument which he he sort of started at the beginning
[715.92-722.10] saying that one would expect for congress to give the president of broadly way
[722.10-724.20] in this kind of foreign affairs context
[725.10-729.51] and i guess i'm wondering whether you also don't have to contend with the
[729.51-734.94] actual purpose of i eat that in making this argument because as i understand
[734.94-738.93] it that the are you by was designed and in intended to limit
[739.77-742.38] pratchett presidential authority that
[743.40-749.46] congress was concerned about how presidents had been using the authority under the predecessor
[749.61-756.87] predecessors statute we're and it's pretty clear that congress was trying to constrain the
[756.87-760.02] emergency powers of the president in i eat bus so it seems a little
[760.02-764.16] inconsistent to say that we have to interpret a statute that was designed to
[764.16-769.56] constrain presidential authority consistent with an understanding that congress wanted the president to have
[769.77-775.08] essentially unlimited authority i disagree with that because what congress actually did ask what
[775.08-778.20] part do you disagree with them sorry why disagree with the notion that they
[778.20-781.59] were trying to constrain the breadth of the actions the president may take when
[781.59-786.33] it comes to this particular narrow domain which is your various regulations of transactions
[786.33-788.91] about how how can you disagree with that i mean that that the history
[788.91-792.54] is what it is good and a series of changes to a hepa yeah
[792.57-797.34] as relate to this triggering condition so to speak and the procedures that apply
[797.35-800.22] with the did not change the language and i write but what was know
[800.25-806.25] what was the so intent of of congress in changing the language wasn't it
[806.25-810.99] to constrain presidential authority in this area to constrain it in the triggering conditions
[810.99-814.44] in the procedures that apply in this are those are the triggering cause they
[814.50-819.78] triggering conditions and procedures that apply our a means to constrain that is how
[819.78-825.63] they went around about constraining but my point is that congress enacted this legislation
[825.63-831.39] with the intent of preventing the president from having unlimited powers in this area
[831.42-835.56] and you're asking us to now interpret that statute consistent with an understanding that
[835.56-841.38] congress wanted to allow the president to do pretty much whatever he wanted in
[841.38-845.49] this area congress took the language from we're in an actor the very same
[845.49-849.81] language and most important here the very same phrase regulate importation in our people
[850.26-854.10] and therefore natural for just congress did not intend to change the scope of
[854.16-858.54] thought that powers the tools the present can exercise any president under it's we're
[858.75-864.27] did any president under we're use that language to impose tariffs well yes president
[864.27-868.17] nixon seventy seventy one tata tara visibly i wasn't a terrorist it was a
[868.17-872.67] licensing agreement during war time it was a sports specific thing
[873.63-877.68] to terrify i'm i'm talking i'm referring to president nixon's nineteen seventy one tell
[877.68-880.44] your as i'm sorry you use meet yes i thought you meant link and
[881.19-883.95] not only that but then it was upheld by the court of appeals with
[883.95-888.30] exclusive jurisdiction wonder this very for can i ran i'm just a second i'm
[888.30-893.34] sorry you're talking so quickly our president nixon did not rely on to yeah
[893.73-897.99] initially to impose tariffs i drag correct i understood that was just a litigating
[897.99-899.94] position that he took once it
[900.00-903.57] the challenge that was not his initial i wouldn't put it that way because
[903.57-907.50] he has a broad indication your i'm evoking all range of statutes something like
[907.50-911.46] that in proclamation forty seventy four and i think the understanding as you want
[911.47-915.42] to spook our allies by invoking the trading with the enemies act by of
[915.42-919.08] specifically invoking it what in litigation was defended on that well to the bottom
[919.08-922.50] of justice defended it as an exercise of we're in did so successful what's
[922.50-927.51] the significance of the nixon example and present here because i like figuring that
[927.51-932.82] out real important to deciding this case correctly so well there's one obvious very
[932.91-936.90] powerful take away from it which is that this harry to word phrase regulate
[936.90-942.18] importation that we say it carries with it the authority to tariff impose regulatory
[942.18-945.69] terrorists at the border forward facing tears at the bora bora and we say
[945.69-947.22] that's a core application of
[948.26-953.76] of the phrase regulate importation had been interpreted two years before congress reenacted that
[953.76-958.50] language in i eat but had been interpreted to carry with it the authority
[958.50-958.92] to
[959.73-963.99] authority to impose tariffs so this court setting algonquin for example and wasn't linux
[963.99-967.47] was just back on the next and what was the scope of the next
[967.47-971.43] and tears tempers he was at ten percent tariff kind of across the board
[971.43-975.99] or major trading partners to address a balance of payments deficit where he was
[975.99-978.48] trying to bring all the major industrial nations
[979.50-983.04] to object to that to the negotiating table she successfully did but for the
[983.04-986.85] imposition of the terrorists and they negotiate the smithsonian agreement about five months after
[986.85-990.18] which he lifted the tariff so the tariff if there was used as here
[990.39-994.35] in part as leverage to get are trading partners to the negotiating table and
[994.35-998.01] it was subsequently upheld by the federal circuit the ccp aids photos look it's
[998.01-1003.35] predecessor that exclusive jurisdiction over that question to include the power to tariff and
[1003.35-1007.22] then two years later congress took that same phrase and reenacted it you're not
[1007.22-1012.20] eat after carefully studying the problem of presidential emergency powers and been deeply concerned
[1012.20-1017.06] about you know excessive or abusive exercise that power shut that whole that whole
[1017.06-1022.07] sort of process good sort of strong sort of confirmation this phrase regular importation
[1022.07-1025.43] carries with the power to tear up now course that's not our leading argument
[1025.43-1031.76] our lead argument interpretation is there's a a pedigree historical pedigree of regulating import
[1031.77-1035.57] specifically where the power to tear of is just the sort of a core
[1035.57-1039.50] application of that a quintessential exercise that power that goes back to give it
[1039.50-1043.10] to gets ogden and just stories treatise and runs all the way through cases
[1043.10-1046.82] like gold rick and board of trustees more can i just ask a question
[1046.82-1050.60] can you point to any other place and the code or any other time
[1050.60-1055.94] in history where that phrase together regulate importation has been used to confer tariff
[1056.03-1061.64] posing authority well as to regulate importation that was held in tweet so obviously
[1061.64-1064.94] and that's okay okay so an intermediate appellate court held that into yeah but
[1064.94-1068.30] you just told just as cabinet that wasn't your lead argument that your lead
[1068.30-1073.64] argument was this long history of the phrase regulate importation being understood to include
[1073.64-1077.54] tariff authority so my question is has there ever been another instance in which
[1077.54-1082.07] a statute has conferred use that language to confirm the power for putting aside
[1082.07-1086.51] yoshida i'm actually other statutory example is just imports the case we rely on
[1086.51-1089.51] are cases where for example given it's are dead and justice stories that that
[1089.51-1093.08] just shows the word can be used that were none of those cases talked
[1093.08-1095.30] about it as conferring tariff authority
[1096.62-1100.37] i understood you to be setting mcgoldrick and gibbons in those cases just to
[1100.37-1105.53] show that it's possible to say that regulating commerce includes the power to tax
[1105.74-1109.19] i think i think argument goes bit further than that is interpreted matter because
[1109.37-1112.76] if you look at that history history of delegates you should censor the justices
[1112.76-1113.18] question
[1114.56-1117.95] and you identify any statues that use that phrase to confer to get the
[1117.95-1121.25] only two statues i can identify now are we are as a germany and
[1121.25-1127.25] yoshida and then closely related not regular importation but adjust imports in section what
[1127.25-1131.00] to thirty two i can't adjust imports is differently so the answer is the
[1131.01-1134.75] contested application and to yeah and then now and ipa
[1135.62-1138.35] and then of course i mean those are there's a sort of direct line
[1138.35-1142.52] there yeah i understand that that attack and then but then more fundamentally we
[1142.52-1146.48] rely on historical sources to so there's as long as storable pedigree of raw
[1146.48-1150.14] delegations of the foreign commerce power not the power to that were not asserting
[1150.14-1155.54] here delegation foreign commerce power to the president going back to gibbons it's against
[1155.75-1159.41] going all way through mcgoldrick and board of trustees where that this court and
[1159.44-1163.34] a and found a good resources say the power to numbers the power to
[1163.34-1167.00] tear of it's kind of this natural you know as everyone knows that includes
[1167.00-1170.92] ask you another dollars and about on the plane text generals hours so you've
[1170.92-1175.61] referred to the other verbs and ipa as capacious would you really describe them
[1175.61-1180.86] as capacious because to me things like nullify and void have definite meanings i
[1180.86-1184.07] agree with you that regulate is a broader term but those words i think
[1184.07-1188.99] are powerful they give say pack a punch but i wouldn't describe them as
[1188.99-1191.93] capacious in the sense that they have a wide range of meaning so can
[1191.93-1194.84] you describe what you mean by capacious over this what you look at all
[1194.84-1198.23] nine verbs together and you're looking at a spectrum of powers from the most
[1198.23-1199.97] sort of negative nullified
[1200.06-1205.55] lock for it void to the most affirmative direct compel and then also powers
[1205.55-1209.93] and between that are more intermediate regulate investigate and so forth so the natural
[1209.93-1214.46] common sense inference from that grammatical structure is the attention of congress to recover
[1214.46-1219.56] the waterfront photographs not possible except congress to take out a whole bunch of
[1219.56-1227.03] verbs it took our confiscate vest hold use administered liquidate cell which were in
[1227.03-1233.54] the prior statute and and and crucially what it doesn't have here is anything
[1233.54-1237.53] that refers to raise in revenue so it has a lot of verbs it
[1237.53-1241.46] has a lot of actions that can be taken under the statute it just
[1241.46-1244.88] doesn't have the one you what why would say the right the notion that
[1244.88-1248.36] all these other verbs are are you start not revenue raising like block and
[1248.36-1252.74] prohibit i think that that argument is unconvincing for two reasons one of course
[1252.74-1256.52] is that we don't we're not saying it confirms a revenue raising power we
[1256.52-1260.51] could say it confirms a regulatory power and that's a crucial distinction but also
[1260.66-1264.32] as but if i can to stop you there regulatory power i mean yes
[1264.38-1268.88] says regulate but is it out brought in out just despair it's question is
[1268.88-1274.01] there any place that you can find in the entire code where regulate used
[1274.28-1280.34] just as regulate includes tax and power we don't assert that we see includes
[1280.40-1284.78] terrifying power when it's combined with importation and that's just the most natural because
[1284.78-1289.64] the natural understand and regulate even even though in fact we can regulate through
[1289.64-1295.31] taxes but when the code uses regulate we don't typically understand it to refer
[1295.55-1299.75] to duties or taxes or tariffs or anything of the kind and then if
[1299.75-1303.08] you look at the flip side of this and you look at all the
[1303.08-1308.45] terrorists statutes that congress has passed and i mean they use language about how
[1308.51-1314.06] revenue raising tariffs and duties and taxes or the language that does not appear
[1314.39-1316.10] in the statue you rely on
[1317.42-1322.22] start with grammatical structure satcher that refer to the other statute to regulate importation
[1322.43-1325.94] you put those two words and combination that's the influence on that is you
[1325.94-1328.91] know the founders discuss with this sort of like you know as everyone knows
[1328.91-1332.96] attitude regular importation of was one of the most natural applications of that is
[1332.96-1337.16] the power to tear so when congress confers the power to regulate imports it
[1337.16-1340.97] is naturally of conferring the power to tear of which has delegate to the
[1340.97-1344.93] executive branch you know again and again and again i'm sorry commercials it doesn't
[1344.93-1352.64] see regularly tariffs it's is regularly importations and exportation you agree that they can't
[1352.64-1358.67] put towers taxes on exportation from institution agree that gets all right so why
[1358.67-1364.88] should we think that it's natural than to think that regulate importation includes taxing
[1364.88-1372.47] importations because that is in conjunction to importations and exportation so if they can't
[1372.56-1378.05] do it with respect to import export stations why are we permitting them to
[1378.05-1383.36] do it with respect to importations because as the scores recognize going back to
[1383.36-1387.11] give us against ogden and going through mcgoldrick and board of how we doing
[1387.41-1391.22] the free when you raising letting anymore it's terrifying is a core application of
[1391.22-1395.54] that so knowledge of you're if you're single regulate trading and securities why you
[1395.54-1399.32] know when to tell from commodores why is it that congress has always use
[1399.32-1401.51] regulate and tax together in the code
[1402.56-1407.66] are you telling us that with respect to choose to regulate in other statute
[1408.38-1409.34] the taxing
[1410.39-1413.51] reference is superfluous they didn't need to do that
[1416.12-1419.93] i'm not sure what what other stature jews regulate and tax together with this
[1419.93-1423.80] statute as a specific historical pedigree going back to it's an advantage during water
[1423.80-1428.48] one at night and seventeen where the phrase regular importation is evoking and inherit
[1428.48-1432.38] power to tariff that would became established in the nineteenth century with in cases
[1432.38-1434.78] like your hamilton to get still and and so forth that histories i think
[1434.78-1437.96] set forth in france or bombsights it's free council got
[1438.92-1443.81] some time ago you dismiss the applicability of the major questions doctrine and i
[1444.65-1448.19] wouldn't want you to explain that a little bit more i mean it seems
[1449.03-1451.52] that it might be directly applicable you have
[1453.05-1456.14] a claim swords and i you with it had never before been used to
[1456.14-1457.19] justify tears
[1458.48-1464.96] no one has argued that it does on to this this particular case congress
[1464.96-1469.67] uses tariffs and other provisions but but but not here and yet
[1470.75-1474.56] and correct me on this if i'm not right about it the justification is
[1474.56-1476.84] being used for a power to
[1477.65-1481.43] impose tariffs on any product from any country
[1482.33-1486.71] for any amount for any length of time it seems like i'm not suggesting
[1486.71-1491.87] it's not there but it does seem like that's major authority and the basis
[1491.87-1497.12] for the claim seems to be a misfit so why does it apply again
[1497.57-1499.89] well we agree that it's a major power but it's
[1500.07-1504.86] context of a statute that is explicitly conferring major powers that point of the
[1504.86-1509.12] statues to confer major powers to address major questions which are emergency so would
[1509.12-1511.67] be unusual say look at the statues a we are going to find a
[1511.67-1516.95] major power well but the exercise the power is to impose tariffs right and
[1516.95-1520.49] the statue of doesn't use the word tariffs but it uses the word regular
[1520.55-1526.40] importation in historically a coup or central application of that a big piece of
[1526.40-1529.46] that has always been to tariff if you had as the founders how do
[1529.46-1532.24] you regulate imports oh so course we tariff that's what we do so with
[1532.24-1536.33] your unusual say we're giving you how to regulate importation to say but you
[1536.33-1540.98] can't impose regulatory tariffs that we also a contradiction in august oracle sources resign
[1540.98-1544.22] our brief you don't relate to that particular historical pedigree and as i was
[1544.22-1548.75] referring to earlier there's a specific pedigree of regular importation here in the specific
[1548.75-1553.82] context of the president's pork and linkedin present mckinley are asserting the authority to
[1553.82-1558.41] impose tariffs in war time that wasn't codify into yeah and then we gotta
[1558.41-1561.83] fight for peacetime and we're ninety thirty three and then carried over into iba
[1562.04-1565.31] so there's that as well but more important if you look at the sort
[1565.31-1570.02] of triggering conditions that numbers this court have identified for the major questions doctrine
[1570.23-1572.63] there's a series of that we think they really do all of them don't
[1572.63-1576.44] apply your for example the notion of the is unheralded a you refer to
[1576.44-1579.62] the fact that he has never been to started to invoke terrorists but of
[1579.62-1585.20] course immediate predecessor statute that it appears that president nixon impose on that were
[1585.20-1588.23] upheld on this very language so this i would say this is it was
[1588.23-1590.78] recount of i don't either two years later this kind of the opposite of
[1590.78-1596.09] unheralded power it's also heralded it because this is a longstanding delegation tradition of
[1596.09-1599.54] delek very broad delegations of the for commerce power going back to the founding
[1599.69-1602.72] going back to your foreign commerce part about but i mean and i think
[1602.72-1606.08] this is a question for the other side as well it's to to facing
[1606.11-1612.35] yes of course herbs dealings with foreign powers but the vehicle is imposition of
[1612.35-1617.21] taxes on on americans and that has always been the core power of congress
[1617.54-1621.17] so to have the president's foreign affairs power trump that that
[1623.27-1625.34] basic power for congress
[1626.25-1627.74] seems to me to kind of at least
[1629.27-1635.96] new neutralize between the two powers the executive power and the legislative power a
[1636.23-1639.47] lovesick shootings response that first the notion that these are the taxes are all
[1639.47-1643.88] born by america's are not borne by for and for and producers who are
[1643.89-1647.99] who's goods are imported as is empirically that's that there's no basis for that
[1647.99-1651.62] the record it's it's actually a big wasn't pays the playoffs if a tariff
[1651.62-1654.20] is imposed on either automobiles
[1655.55-1659.12] to pay them there's a dick typically there be a regatta with the importer
[1659.12-1661.55] of record he is there be a contract that would go along the sort
[1661.55-1665.27] of line of transfer that would allocate the that terrified that be different getting
[1665.34-1669.86] sometimes that foreign the foreign producer would pay them sometimes the importer would bear
[1669.86-1672.44] the costs the important could be an american could be a foreign company a
[1672.44-1676.40] lot of times it's a whole a wholly owned american subsidiary of foreign corporation
[1676.55-1679.76] so it gets allocated to the the pupil estimates ranged from like thirty percent
[1679.76-1683.06] to eighty percent of like how much as worn by mean it's been suggested
[1683.06-1687.35] that the terrorists are responsible for significant reduction in our deficit i would say
[1687.35-1691.91] that's raising revenue domestically there there certainly is incidental on collateral effect of the
[1691.91-1695.72] two years they do raise revenue but it's very important that they are regulatory
[1695.72-1698.87] terrorists not revenue raising tears and the way you can see this i think
[1699.08-1702.95] if you look at this policy this policy is by far the most effective
[1703.07-1706.16] if nobody ever pays the terrorists i like to policies right so if you
[1706.16-1710.18] look at the trade deficit emergency if nobody ever pays the terrorists and instead
[1710.18-1715.13] americans direct their consumption towards american producers and stimulate the rebuilding of our hollowed
[1715.13-1719.15] out manufacturing base than the policy is by far the most effective so a
[1719.15-1723.89] tear of israel wider of that why not do with the statue permits
[1724.73-1726.98] bar importation of products altogether
[1728.33-1730.55] that would be the most effective way to do it
[1732.20-1735.68] what the question miles of the search the statute says the president can do
[1735.68-1739.91] that would it doesn't say is a prison president can raise revenues
[1741.74-1745.34] what it says that he can regulate importation and going to get a hundred
[1745.46-1748.13] years that way you orders to are seeing it
[1749.78-1757.43] subjecting some countries and not others to importation bands there's a lot of verbs
[1758.06-1761.06] but none of them include generating revenue
[1762.44-1764.96] as a side effect or directly
[1766.49-1769.64] it let me let me address that verb point if i make us think
[1769.64-1773.42] about the canonical example a statue that refers to a list of swords knives
[1773.42-1777.20] daggers dirks and pikes they are you look at those that that list of
[1777.20-1780.05] things you say ah those are all weapons there for a pike is a
[1780.14-1784.70] spear not not a fish in that particular context now look at this list
[1784.70-1788.63] of verbs block prohibit capelle direct and so forth you don't look at that
[1788.63-1791.39] naturally is in or near reruns they all look for all not revenue raising
[1791.57-1794.63] what you say is they're all very broad powerful
[1795.47-1798.98] general actions or the general that the verbs that are in the statute are
[1798.98-1799.97] actually doing
[1800.06-1804.05] something i mean they're in the statute for a reason and as i understand
[1804.05-1810.59] it congress actually explained to us in it's senate report and house report when
[1810.59-1815.81] it enacted the nineteen forty one amendments to we're what it was doing it
[1815.81-1821.09] said that what we're doing is authorizing the president the senate report quote to
[1821.09-1827.63] control or freeze property transactions were foreign interest is in pulled your similar language
[1827.66-1834.38] about controlling freezing control in the house report so i appreciate that generally you
[1834.38-1837.68] can look at these words and you can imagine that they mean certain things
[1837.68-1842.48] but here we have evidence that congress was actually trying to do a particular
[1842.48-1846.89] thing with respect to the authority that it was presenting to the president and
[1846.89-1849.20] that thing was not raising revenue
[1850.94-1854.54] i think that what kind of the powers that congress was conferring on the
[1854.54-1858.47] present our best understood to the plain text the statute which includes regulating blowing
[1858.47-1861.50] up with some of us care about the legislative history and so the planes
[1861.50-1865.88] that text of the statute has certain verbs and it it also has regulate
[1866.09-1867.44] commerce as you say
[1868.52-1872.96] and when i look at the legislative history it appears as though congress was
[1872.96-1878.57] trying to give the president the authority to quote control or freeze property transactions
[1878.57-1882.32] were for an interest is involved and in the tweet context that makes perfect
[1882.32-1887.51] sense because we're talking about a wartime dynamic and in what is happening is
[1887.51-1892.28] the president needs the authority to prevent trading with the enemy in the midst
[1892.31-1896.24] of a war and that seems to be the focus of this statute so
[1896.24-1900.26] i guess i'm concerned about just sort of taking a particular word here and
[1900.26-1906.23] there and saying that the general view of it might include raising revenue when
[1906.23-1910.07] in fact it looks as though the aim of this was really to give
[1910.07-1914.60] the president a certain kind of authority to freeze the assets of the of
[1914.60-1917.69] the enemy and i music do things in response at first as the notion
[1917.69-1922.07] that this is a revenue raising tactic or power it is not we are
[1922.07-1926.15] asserting it regulatory power it's a delegation of power to regulate foreign commerce the
[1926.15-1930.44] way to control imports traditionally has been to of them they say well you
[1930.44-1934.10] can post quoted as well cause there's actually economically you you know economically equivalent
[1934.18-1936.65] terrorists so the question is why would you be able to kowtow and to
[1936.66-1940.67] regulate but not terrifying to regulate when the terrorist or themselves regulatory and let
[1940.67-1942.86] me turn back to the question i was get their response or it's good
[1942.86-1947.69] the answer used to illustrate the answer be that in other places where congress
[1947.69-1954.92] wants that particular form of regulation to be used they say impose duties they
[1954.92-1956.60] say contacts
[1957.59-1960.11] mister president here they don't say that
[1961.01-1964.49] i think shootings response that that's the very argument that this court rejected and
[1964.49-1968.45] algonquin that the fact that these other specifics to actually just moved to you
[1968.45-1971.54] about where you have to live we disagree with you that algonquin is a
[1971.54-1975.59] similar context do you have another statute or another circumstance and together not as
[1975.60-1980.15] i don't go to can brag but i'll get disgusted the phrase adjust imports
[1980.33-1982.49] and this sort other natural i to do that has to terror feminine and
[1982.49-1987.05] they specifically said it makes no sense at all to a to authorize quotas
[1987.05-1991.10] which was conceded that that such a good authorized but not terrorists because those
[1991.10-1995.15] are equivalent but he decided it was asked by any means necessary which kind
[1995.15-1999.47] of beefs that the adjust and also and this is actually i just don't
[1999.47-2002.14] know the answer to this question so maybe it can happen maybe the other
[2002.14-2006.46] side can help as well algonquin was very careful to always call it a
[2006.46-2010.39] license and a licensing fee and and the oral argument that came up to
[2010.39-2013.42] the distinction between a tariff and a licensing fee and i can understand how
[2013.42-2016.81] and some context it would be very difficult you would press on it and
[2016.81-2019.45] you say well if this license fee is raising revenue
[2020.44-2024.25] then it it actually functions as a tariff but what is the significance of
[2024.25-2028.93] that because and i eat it also says it refers a spell at particularly
[2028.93-2034.42] to licenses and says you can license and license would be a way of
[2035.11-2040.75] giving permission and that's actually the lat the language also used and in the
[2040.76-2042.06] civil war one and
[2043.32-2046.54] it hasn't happened yet actually yes it does it was a license it was
[2046.54-2050.68] a licence fee and that's a way to grant permission that you wouldn't otherwise
[2050.68-2054.10] have to to trade and important let it through september you tell me what
[2054.10-2057.97] the distinction as between licenses and reason if it matters charge really see one
[2058.03-2062.50] because what president lincoln said as okay we're going allow imports from hostile foreign
[2062.50-2067.15] powers basically rebellious confederate states of cotton submit to a license and but you
[2067.15-2069.37] gotta pay for cents a pound a cotton when you do it that's the
[2069.37-2073.60] condition that is is is so nearly equipment to a whatever of this as
[2073.60-2076.81] you can bring this goods your a country really gotta pay advil our your
[2076.81-2077.77] advil oram
[2078.67-2083.50] assessment on it and so it in it of course they have in their
[2083.50-2087.58] brief can see that coders apply that licensing may apply there is the language
[2087.58-2089.77] in the beginning of seventy one that talks about instruments
[2090.64-2093.49] or other methods or instruments license that if that is your why couldn't you
[2093.49-2097.24] just call this a license and it's it's also true that in the cotton
[2097.24-2099.91] example the court said the exact should itself was not
[2100.03-2105.19] properly attacks but a bonus required as a condition precedent for engaging in the
[2105.19-2109.54] trade so it seems like it was a little swirly about how it was
[2109.54-2112.90] proceeding and if if if there really has no distinction why couldn't you just
[2112.90-2116.23] call it a license here very briefly the other two cases you know the
[2116.23-2120.34] pork case and then the present the gates taught about duties so you to
[2120.34-2124.09] quit was there are just going to council just as thomas and further
[2124.96-2131.11] from the other side is going to argue make an argument delegation i believe
[2131.44-2137.38] would you anticipate that and give us your understanding of the delegation argued that
[2137.47-2140.41] yes justice thomas i'd say a couple things in response to that first of
[2140.41-2140.83] all
[2142.12-2146.74] this court has stated that the non delegation dog does not apply with anything
[2146.74-2150.58] like the same force in in as it doesn't matter contacts in the foreign
[2150.58-2155.62] contacts and that again to cite games more again games more sites youngstown and
[2155.62-2159.55] youngstown and footnote to have to judge justice jackson's opinion he goes into detail
[2159.55-2162.82] about this he addresses kurdish right he says is a lot of radhika in
[2162.83-2166.69] kurdish right what the holding of courage right the rats you're just dundee is
[2166.69-2170.05] that the not the domestic not delegation doctrine does not apply this a portion
[2170.29-2173.05] in the foreign contacts and then you any use that for it's does not
[2173.05-2177.04] applies as the strict limitations on delegation that apply you know an internal contacts
[2177.04-2181.39] don't do not apply in the extra context or we rely on that line
[2181.39-2184.51] of cases and further reason i talked about earlier were talking about a situation
[2184.51-2187.99] where the present has his own inherit authority to address for the rising emergencies
[2188.17-2192.97] and congress is confirming tools on him that expand his as capacity do so
[2193.15-2195.04] we are in the area of youngstown zone one
[2196.18-2201.07] and a few times you have alluded to the history as being important in
[2201.07-2209.47] interpreting the statue and also that this language comes from the trading with the
[2209.47-2212.47] enemy say and that has it's own pedigree
[2213.46-2217.87] could use your sketch out this direct line that you were alluding to as
[2218.14-2219.73] a basis for interpreting
[2220.66-2225.67] the current emergency statute as you would like interpret yes justice thomas and journey
[2225.67-2228.40] back to the response i was given to just a spirit earlier there is
[2228.40-2231.22] i think it's very well the set out a press or bombsights amicus brief
[2231.64-2236.68] there is this history of president's using a terrifying power tariff of equivalent power
[2236.68-2241.99] very very close to terrifying power in war time to tariff trading with enemies
[2241.99-2245.38] and that it when the trading with the enemy act was enacted in nineteen
[2245.38-2249.19] seventy was deliberately evoking that and when it brings in the power to regulate
[2249.19-2256.03] importation it's essentially codifying for that inherent power the presents already recognized to have
[2256.03-2259.33] and then and ninety thirty three when that powers expand into an area where
[2259.33-2263.83] he wouldn't inherently habit the peacetime contacts that codification the meaning of that remains
[2263.83-2267.79] that saying that regulate importation language that's brought in front we are in that
[2267.79-2271.24] ultimately to eat or you back in nineteen seventy seven is carrying with it
[2271.24-2275.05] that connotation and that's reinforced by all the case resign our brief where there's
[2275.05-2278.89] been extremely broad delegations of the power to terror of specifically and the power
[2278.89-2283.03] to regulate foreign commerce more generally going back to the time found which ties
[2283.04-2284.23] your question about not delegation
[2286.18-2286.90] justice alito
[2290.26-2296.08] as a quarter of the c c p a said several said things and
[2296.11-2301.48] yoshida that are helpful to your position but it also said some other things
[2302.20-2307.63] it said that future search or charges quote must of course comply with section
[2307.63-2314.53] one twenty two of the trade act of nineteen seventy four said that the
[2314.53-2319.51] trading with the enemy act did not authorize the president to quote fix rates
[2319.51-2324.82] of duty will without regard to statutory rape prescribed by congress so
[2326.32-2332.11] do you think that congress to the extent of congress had that decision mind
[2332.11-2336.23] and relied on it you think it also relied on those things in the
[2336.23-2339.40] opinion it not in the same way because those statements are ready to other
[2339.40-2342.49] versions of tweet that congress did not imagine any but i may still be
[2342.49-2345.61] there and tweet but those are limitations that it wouldn't make sense to do
[2345.61-2348.58] and i think the significance of your does at a higher level here in
[2348.58-2352.60] mind that their principal opposition is no terrorists at all regulate importation just doesn't
[2352.60-2356.02] carry a connotation of the power to tariff and we say we gotta historical
[2356.02-2359.35] sources going back to give it's it gets argument say the opposite but more
[2359.35-2363.31] fundamentally everyone knew that at the time i was an hour to that regular
[2363.31-2367.72] importation of just very visibly and very prominently been up held to can include
[2367.72-2369.55] a very a sweeping global terror
[2370.51-2370.87] thank you
[2372.01-2375.58] assume there i'd like to go back to just despair it's question on the
[2375.58-2380.80] words licenses use and people it's not use as a verb it's uses a
[2380.81-2381.19] now
[2382.27-2388.36] by the parade president me under such regulations as he may prescribe by means
[2388.36-2391.36] of instructions licenses or otherwise
[2392.26-2397.54] then do with the verbs permit him to do my license he can nullify
[2397.54-2399.91] boy prevent to prohibit any yeah
[2400.06-2405.67] sushi like her so licenses not being used as a verb that through licensing
[2405.67-2407.35] he can raise revenue
[2408.16-2411.82] economy and only use licenses to accomplish the verbs
[2413.68-2418.06] so i don't understand how we can treat licensing is equivalent
[2420.31-2421.54] to revenue raising
[2422.50-2428.02] it as use an ipa the licenses only to accomplish with be permit in
[2428.02-2431.83] hamilton against deal and licenses once you have a license that you had to
[2431.83-2436.06] pay the fees but that's just even those are going on making ditches that
[2436.06-2441.01] the only use of license year is now where you can license to accomplish
[2441.31-2445.06] the powers that be gives the present let me be clear we rely on
[2445.06-2449.23] the phrase regular importation are not saying the exact and hear that relying on
[2449.23-2453.16] licenses for that reason i only site that language at dodger language about you
[2453.16-2457.33] know instruments licenses that other other white rely on adding another layer of breath
[2457.33-2460.99] and this project council which you listen to my question you're not relying on
[2460.99-2465.91] licence for the reason i just said cause it is a noun not the
[2465.91-2473.74] verb you're relying on regulate correct yes riot regulate importation and despite the fact
[2473.74-2479.92] that no other president in the history of iba has ever use has ever
[2479.92-2480.58] imported
[2481.51-2487.39] use tariffs as a power under arifa well president nixon did so on your
[2487.42-2490.90] predecessor and we have all the limitations of that are a
[2492.46-2499.99] number two whenever congress and tendency to permit taxing and regulate it uses the
[2499.99-2503.68] word tax and regulate in every other statute correct
[2504.97-2509.30] die don't see that i'm into to very visible examples again art and section
[2509.30-2512.98] on twitter where we're back to the limit the question here okay thank you
[2512.98-2513.28] can't
[2514.12-2514.87] just assume you
[2515.68-2517.33] know she's and just a city area
[2518.92-2519.01] and
[2520.54-2521.62] she just finished
[2522.58-2523.67] just as a
[2526.42-2527.59] general their friends
[2529.90-2533.20] i want to take you back to justice thomas this question about non delegation
[2533.20-2537.31] and if i understood your answer correctly was really similar to the answer that
[2537.31-2541.36] you started off with when you talk with justice thomas about the major questions
[2541.36-2547.57] doctrine which is sort of everything's different because the president has independent constitutional powers
[2547.60-2552.07] in this area and so that if if if one does not think that
[2552.10-2556.66] with respect to tariffs if one thinks that a tariff is his attacks and
[2556.68-2563.17] power is a regulation of foreign commerce that is really delegated by the constitution
[2563.17-2569.50] to congress that argument does not does not sound so well and in fact
[2569.56-2574.30] when you look at j w hampton which gives rise to the nine delegation
[2574.30-2579.70] tested that we usually use jw hampton is a tariffs case and the court
[2579.70-2584.59] did not say oh we need some special new principal hear some stricter rules
[2584.62-2590.08] because we're dealing with tariffs and which presidents are directly concerned as a matter
[2590.08-2594.76] of foreign relations it a nancy aided the test we use for on non
[2594.76-2599.89] delegations so how does that fit with your theory eight years later in cutters
[2599.89-2603.55] right the court held that not out asian doctrine for domestic affairs does not
[2603.55-2608.11] apply the same forces does but not with respect to terrorists not with respect
[2608.14-2613.30] to quintessential taxing powers which are given by the constitution to congress i think
[2613.30-2616.84] justice of this court have recognize in their opinions that one of the reasons
[2616.84-2621.40] that the non delegation doctrine you know that a judge or principal task to
[2621.40-2624.21] as impact as much punches just as cavalier side one of the opinions as
[2624.23-2627.97] my otherwise have done as it did arise in a foreign affairs contacts because
[2627.97-2631.51] they are the court has historically been very very comfortable with very broad allegations
[2631.69-2635.98] chicago in southern airlines altercation the ninety thirty shortly after job we haven't talked
[2635.98-2640.75] about be very large delegations before congress power being very effective and course this
[2640.75-2644.50] goes back to the very dawn of the republican seventeen ninety for example congress
[2644.50-2649.30] confront on present washington basically the entire indian commerce power is that go you
[2649.30-2652.66] know get licenses right to do commerce of the indians and be starting to
[2652.66-2656.74] whatever rules and regulations present washing can make so i do think there's a
[2656.78-2659.29] a profound consistency between
[2660.16-2664.63] the an awesome intelligible principal tested and jb hampton and then the subsequent recognition
[2664.63-2668.80] by this court in right that the non delegation talking doesn't mean i would
[2668.80-2673.87] say portion is caught in consumers research just last year we had attacks before
[2673.87-2678.19] us in the question was was this a delegation issue because of course a
[2678.19-2679.72] much smaller tax
[2680.92-2681.40] which
[2683.23-2689.20] dealt with many fewer tax payers notwithstanding that we said if there's no ceiling
[2689.23-2693.01] on this tax we should have assumed that if there were no ceiling on
[2693.01-2698.62] this tax it would raise a delegation problem and the most of the opinion
[2698.62-2699.91] was given over to show
[2700.33-2704.08] that they're in fact was a ceiling on the tax not a quantitative one
[2704.08-2705.55] but a qualitative one
[2706.78-2711.88] but how does your argument fit with the idea that attacks with no ceiling
[2711.91-2717.13] attacks that can be anything that hear the president wants their and agency once
[2717.37-2719.17] would raise a pretty deep
[2720.07-2724.81] delegation problem for us all i can't say enough is it regularly regulatory terror
[2725.05-2728.80] attacks and that i think ties to my response to that which is that
[2728.98-2732.88] this is a totally different context this is i iba a statue that congress
[2732.88-2737.70] carefully crafted degree at the president bitterly broad powers to address for in a
[2737.72-2742.06] rising emergencies it's outward facing to foreign affairs where there's the broadest level of
[2742.06-2746.50] deference to the political branches of this quarter's recognize that many cases and imposed
[2746.53-2749.65] not a floor limit on the amount of tears i could be imposed very
[2749.65-2753.76] naturally because for example just court said it loving quoting you know thousand and
[2753.76-2758.14] hamilton and the federals number twenty three it's impossible for see either what exit
[2758.14-2762.28] she's may arise or what tools maybe need to address those actually means that
[2762.28-2766.57] may be required to address those agencies instead congress great very broad powers but
[2766.57-2771.07] they're confined to a particular domain this domain is any property in which any
[2771.07-2776.08] foreign government or any national their of has any interest so that that sort
[2776.08-2778.51] of discipline if one were to apply we say you shouldn't but if you
[2778.51-2779.57] would apply the
[2780.38-2784.93] non delegation doctrine that domestic facing not delegation doctor in this context there's a
[2784.96-2788.47] significant limitation there yeah or use of you have the lot of my last
[2788.47-2792.40] question really does have to do with that point which is how or whether
[2792.40-2797.05] this is confined because if you look at title nineteen which is loaded with
[2797.14-2799.33] tariffs and duties of various kinds
[2800.59-2805.00] all of them have real constraints on them there are you know you can't
[2805.00-2810.07] go over x percent or it can't last more than one year and of
[2810.07-2815.35] course the way you interpret this statute it has none of those constraints and
[2815.35-2818.29] the question arises why it is that any
[2819.13-2824.92] president ever would look to the tariffs and title nineteen if subs to lend
[2824.92-2829.90] to year with you will this statute gives the president the opportunity to blow
[2829.90-2831.49] past those limits
[2832.54-2836.11] this statute has it's own constraints the are constraints that are appropriate for the
[2836.11-2840.97] context which is internationally rising emergencies they are carefully crafted by congress to address
[2840.97-2845.02] that and they are immediately different there and section seventy one the president's to
[2845.02-2850.36] make a formal declaration of a national emergency which subjects him to particularly intensive
[2850.39-2856.21] oversight by congress repudio natural lapsing repeat review reports in so for that says
[2856.21-2858.85] you have to consult with congress to do that back some i mean younger
[2858.85-2863.23] self think that the declaration of emergency is unreviewable and even if it's not
[2863.23-2868.54] unreviewable it's of course the kind of determination that this court would grant considerable
[2868.54-2872.38] deference to the to the president on so that doesn't seem like much of
[2872.38-2876.52] a constraint but it is an insight you know we've had cases recently which
[2876.52-2880.48] deals with the president's emergency powers and and turns out where in emergencies everything
[2880.48-2885.70] all the time about like half the world while this particular emergencies particularly existential
[2885.70-2888.91] as executive order fourteen two five seven says and of course no one disputes
[2888.91-2893.14] the existential nature of the financial crisis which you know we had a agreement
[2893.14-2896.95] last week to create progress on which illustrates the focus of the terrorist or
[2896.95-2899.86] here but the point i would make in response to that is those are
[2899.89-2903.40] even if if there's limited judicial review which is very natural and foreign affairs
[2903.40-2907.65] contacts this court is always kinda a always granted that the president the the
[2907.81-2910.93] presumption that he's actually in good faith or you hotels they are very sick
[2910.93-2915.16] every it's gotta be unusual extraordinary threat that arises more substantial part outside the
[2915.16-2919.87] united states was entirely for facing into the national security economy or
[2920.80-2924.25] uniform policy of the united states so there there are those then there's you
[2924.25-2927.49] know seventy you know one be which talks about can be used for this
[2927.49-2931.14] and in for no other purpose than there are limitations of section seventy two
[2931.15-2934.45] oh to be then there is that limitations i refer to earlier about what
[2934.48-2937.15] he can actually do you do a heck of a lot but only when
[2937.15-2940.15] he's dealing with property in which foreigners have an interest and that's a pretty
[2940.48-2943.72] narrow domain that's that's quite a sight of oh so to speak and then
[2943.72-2947.53] of course overarching at all there's congressional oversight and you may say congressional oversight
[2947.53-2952.15] me that much bite but congress didn't think so congress crafted this compromise it
[2952.18-2955.60] balance the never ending tension when it when it draft a bite out his
[2955.63-2959.47] eyes open as as the descent los as it's eyes open looking at the
[2959.47-2964.39] problem of sweeping emergency powers for an executive who may use them in a
[2964.39-2969.22] way that's excessive versus the need to address unforeseeable thank you journals just score
[2969.22-2969.58] such
[2970.72-2974.68] general just a few questions following up on the major questions discussions you pad
[2976.21-2980.29] you say that the we shouldn't be so concerned in the area of foreign
[2980.29-2985.84] affairs because the president's inherit powers that's the gist of it as i understand
[2985.93-2989.23] why we should disregard both major questions and delegation
[2990.52-2996.34] to congress delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations
[2996.67-2999.94] as he sees fit to a and collect duties
[3000.09-3004.04] as he sees fit we we don't we don't assert that here though the
[3004.05-3007.63] much harder case now in seventy nine and that the logic of your of
[3007.63-3010.26] of your view that i don't think so because we're dealing with the statute
[3010.26-3013.74] that was it carefully crafted compromise it does have all the limitations that i
[3013.74-3017.94] just talked about you say hello to be shooting a concerned with i want
[3017.94-3021.36] to explain to me how you draw the line because you say we shouldn't
[3021.36-3025.14] be concerned because this is foreign affairs the president has an errand authority and
[3025.14-3031.00] so delegation off the books more or less already so that's nice room was
[3031.00-3036.39] what would what would prohibit congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate point
[3036.39-3040.11] commerce that matter declare war two the president
[3041.01-3043.89] we don't contend that he could do that if you get why not well
[3043.89-3046.50] because we're dealing with the statue again that has a horse i'm not as
[3046.50-3049.77] it's about the stations general i'm not asking about the statue i'm asking for
[3049.77-3055.89] your theory of the constitution and wide major questions and non delegation what bite
[3055.89-3058.80] it would have in that case i would say by then you move from
[3058.83-3062.61] the area where there's enormous difference to the president actually both a political branches
[3062.61-3065.79] were here there's inherent authority and pile on top of that there's a broader
[3065.85-3070.50] you're saying there's inheritance already in foreign affairs of foreign affairs so regulate commerce
[3070.53-3074.01] duties and to it and tariffs and war
[3074.88-3079.56] it's inherent thirty all the way down you say five congress decides to my
[3080.13-3083.73] when we're tired of this legislative business we're just going to head off to
[3083.73-3089.01] the president what would stop congress from doing that that would be different than
[3089.04-3092.04] a situation where there are meets inbound so to speak it would be a
[3092.07-3096.39] wholesale you say we've we've we're not here to judge meet some pounds one's
[3096.39-3100.50] before that that's what i'm struggling with you'd have to have some test and
[3100.50-3104.88] if it isn't the intelligible principal test or something more with more bite them
[3104.88-3109.05] that you're saying something less what is that last i think what the court
[3109.05-3112.65] has said in it's opinions is just that it applies with much less for
[3112.65-3116.58] some more limited application and this contacts so perhaps try to approach it is
[3116.58-3120.48] a very very deferential application of the intel multiple jobs will principal just that
[3120.48-3124.20] that's sort of wholesale application are so now you're admitting you there is some
[3124.20-3128.58] none delegation principal at play here and there for major questions as well either
[3128.58-3132.51] right or a limited very very deferential over that it is white and again
[3132.51-3135.48] that is that the phrase that justice jackson uses it just does not apply
[3135.51-3138.24] these i know but that's where you started off and now you've retreated from
[3138.24-3141.78] that as i understand it well i think we would it as our front
[3141.78-3145.38] my position is search stronger position but the court doesn't accept it then if
[3145.38-3148.47] there is a highly can you and reason to accept that that's what i'm
[3148.47-3152.31] struggling and waiting for what's the reason to accept the notion that congress can
[3152.31-3156.36] and off the power to declare war to the press that we don't content
[3156.36-3159.66] that again that will you do you do you say some reviewable there's no
[3159.72-3163.98] manageable standard nothing to be done and now you're of i think you tell
[3163.98-3168.66] me if i brought you back off that position ah maybe that's fair to
[3168.66-3172.83] say okay nora how like a good abdication that really be an application not
[3172.83-3175.20] of delegates i'm delighted to hear that
[3177.00-3181.20] are i want to return to something just to sort of my or asked
[3181.23-3185.31] under the statute okay so now we're in the statute that's major questions question
[3185.31-3191.22] though could the president impose a fifty percent tariff on gas powered cars and
[3191.25-3196.92] auto parts to deal with the usual and extraordinary thread from abroad of climate
[3196.92-3201.06] change it's very likely that can be done that very likely i think that
[3201.06-3204.75] has to be any logic of your you know there's an average this administration
[3204.75-3206.79] would say that's a hoax it's not a real crisis but
[3207.60-3210.63] i'm sure you would yes but i'll be a question for congress under our
[3210.63-3216.30] interpretation after the courts or it and then you are on this inherent authority
[3216.30-3216.74] idea
[3217.95-3222.45] does i take i understand the president's inherit authority and wartime and lot of
[3222.45-3226.68] your examples of regulating commerce and maybe your best one hamilton during the civil
[3226.68-3227.10] war
[3227.94-3232.98] the the courtroom wartime where the president's commander in chief power is clearly and
[3232.98-3233.40] play
[3234.36-3238.59] does the president have inherent authority over tariffs in peacetime
[3239.46-3243.12] know we do not content that and in fact i'd i'd say that if
[3243.12-3246.75] i may i point to court to two cases they're loving against united states
[3246.75-3250.35] and then mazur a that site in loving those are situation for example loving
[3250.35-3254.31] it's united states that the president broad article to and here and authority there
[3254.31-3257.88] was the commander in chief power but this court held he does not have
[3257.88-3261.48] inherited already to do the power that was delegate private has the power to
[3261.78-3265.29] you know identify aggregators that make eligible for the death penalty in court martial
[3265.32-3269.31] trials in this court said we're not going to see a delegation problem here
[3269.52-3273.60] even though which we a wholesale delegation which would otherwise be legislative authority would
[3273.60-3276.42] be kind of i get a small version of what your hypothetical would be
[3276.42-3279.66] an application that because you're in a foreign affairs context where they are commander
[3279.66-3283.62] in chief military contacts with present has it's own delegation with already he doesn't
[3283.62-3287.04] have the power to do this because of his background it here in authority
[3287.04-3290.67] the court said this is a situation where i can see a delegation problem
[3290.67-3294.18] when they're clearly would have been a delegation problem that domestic context and those
[3294.18-3297.54] case i think are powerful heat general if i can cut through those words
[3298.26-3300.00] i think you're say that know the price
[3300.00-3304.95] that and doesn't have inherent authority over tariffs in peacetime absolutely i was really
[3304.95-3308.10] do not assert that we say that congress can delegate that to him and
[3308.10-3312.58] when congress does as it does we use afraid phrase regulate important i i
[3312.66-3315.84] i i i i for one i of all that okay
[3317.49-3321.69] you emphasize the congress can always take back it's powers that much that a
[3321.69-3322.59] couple of times
[3323.43-3329.13] but don't we have a serious retrieval problem here because once congress delegates to
[3329.13-3332.55] buy a bare majority in the president signs and of course every president will
[3332.55-3334.44] sign a law that gives them more authority
[3336.03-3341.52] congress can't take that back without a supermajority and even play yeah even then
[3341.55-3345.75] it's gonna be veto proof what president's ever going to give that power back
[3346.38-3351.69] pretty rare president so what would you how did how should that inform our
[3351.69-3355.86] view delegations and major question would look at the balance of congress struck because
[3355.86-3359.16] what congress did initially it had a to house legislative v child and we
[3359.16-3362.31] just want the adrenalin shot ago and then congress went back to the statue
[3362.31-3366.15] and amended it took out the legislative veto and left in the joint resolution
[3366.15-3369.21] but still left thousand and with all those spot ya that's what's in that's
[3369.21-3373.53] what congress did i guess for enough a icky it is a practical matter
[3373.65-3377.19] in the real world it can never get their power back i disagree because
[3377.19-3380.76] in january twenty twenty three congress voted to terminate one of the biggest are
[3380.76-3384.30] you emergencies merged ever the covert emergency and the present went along with that
[3384.45-3387.84] so what the statute reflexes there's gonna be the ability for a sort of
[3388.14-3392.22] political consensus against the declared emerged what happens on the frozen similarly there's a
[3392.22-3396.93] ito's legislation to try to take these powers back for he has the authority
[3396.93-3400.35] to veto legislation to terminate a national emergency for i'm i mean he retains
[3400.35-3403.29] the powers in the background because i even still on the books but if
[3403.29-3406.41] he declares an emergency and congress doesn't like it and passes a joint resolution
[3406.62-3409.08] yes you can actually feature that your i was sort of congress as a
[3409.08-3413.49] practical matter can't get this power back once it's handed it over the president's
[3413.49-3415.68] a one way ratchet toward the
[3416.55-3421.17] gradual but continue accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the
[3421.17-3425.55] people's elected representatives i disagree with that in the recent historical counter example of
[3425.55-3431.25] congress his termination of a covert emergency demonstrates that political political oversight with the
[3431.25-3435.42] president's giant meaning for him with the presence of set in fact once a
[3435.42-3438.54] lawsuit by veto proof majority in the senate i think the position in the
[3438.75-3441.63] right and you realize and that's that's the political process working there was an
[3441.79-3445.47] elixir central majority kids little home a lot majority to get it back
[3446.43-3446.79] okay
[3448.80-3451.92] one other question do you think terrorists are always foreign affairs
[3454.59-3457.74] i do think they would i can't think of a situation where you're not
[3457.74-3461.61] for and facing your talk about terrorists on imports i mean neither other terror
[3461.61-3465.09] of contacts that i'm aware of but yeah that typically would involve a foreign
[3465.09-3468.54] affairs thing however is in good as it gets arjun if they are revenue
[3468.54-3472.23] raising tariffs they would not raise the same sort of like foreign affairs issues
[3472.23-3476.31] as regulatory tariffs which are impose not for the purpose of raising revenue by
[3476.46-3480.39] to induce foreign powers to change their behavior is so revenue raising tariffs are
[3480.39-3485.69] not foreign affairs but regulatory tariffs are i don't forget a revenue raising tariff
[3485.69-3488.12] would be foreign affairs same degree at least i think it has a for
[3488.13-3491.82] an application obviously but i don't think it would raise the same issues thank
[3491.82-3492.18] you joe
[3493.08-3499.98] scarborough figuring out what relate importation means is because obviously central here and for
[3499.98-3501.81] major questions purposes
[3502.65-3506.91] i think the way we think about that kind of question is does the
[3508.50-3518.13] specific authority power major power now asserted pursuant to that general statutory authorization was
[3518.13-3519.84] that the kind of power
[3520.77-3523.08] that would have been understood
[3523.95-3529.44] by people by congress at the time the general statue was passed as distinct
[3529.44-3534.78] from being a novel kind of use of that general authority to do something
[3534.87-3538.26] different unheralded is the word in our case okay
[3539.67-3544.56] one problem you have is that president sense you have not done this your
[3544.80-3548.88] primary answer a one of your many answers to that is the next and
[3549.00-3554.10] example and that's a good example for you because nixon relied on regulate importation
[3554.10-3560.49] to impose a worldwide tariff good example what is our understanding of congress and
[3560.49-3567.15] nineteen seventy seven visa v that nixon example when congress reenacts or an axe
[3567.63-3570.99] the regulate importation language entirely by
[3571.98-3577.05] congress at that time was fully aware that a court of appeals exclusive jurisdiction
[3577.11-3581.25] interpreted that very for is very visibly very prominently to include the power to
[3581.25-3586.26] tariff and that reenacted it without change the court address kind of lesser situation
[3586.26-3589.44] algonquin where it would came to section one twenty two and the court said
[3589.44-3594.62] president nixon a corset president nixon interpreted this to include a a terrifying power
[3594.84-3598.80] turf like power and then congress few months later reenacted the language about changing
[3598.80-3600.00] that's powerful have and so congrats
[3600.00-3604.65] the acquiescence it's not immediately historical background is very powerful it's buttressed of course
[3604.65-3608.28] by source is going back to the founding where we say the phrase regular
[3608.31-3612.96] importation a quintessential application of that is the power to terrorists that's how you
[3612.96-3619.14] regulators this may require some speculation on your part economic philosophy excedrin have been
[3619.14-3625.62] all asking why do you think president's clinton bush obama have not
[3626.70-3631.20] used i eat iba to impose tariffs on because there have been
[3632.01-3637.47] trade disputes and certainly you know president bush steel imports and like why do
[3637.47-3640.05] you think i eat has not been news if you look at those sixty
[3640.05-3642.72] nine emergencies in fact to go through them one at a time which we
[3642.72-3645.69] had our team do it's really hard to find one way you look at
[3645.69-3649.47] that emergency you say oh tariffs is the natural tool you would use to
[3649.47-3654.78] address that emergency so for example that blood diamond emergency your terrifying these sort
[3654.78-3659.13] of your criminal organization and africa that are financing terrorism to sail diamonds even
[3659.14-3663.33] really care of them are you take you know that iranian hostage crisis prison
[3663.36-3666.75] guardian sale you see all of our it you know embassy personnel you're holding
[3666.75-3669.21] them hostage we're going to tear if you ride in you go through those
[3669.21-3673.38] a mercy there are two emerges were tears of the obvious natural tool for
[3673.38-3677.31] a president to use one is the nixon balance of payments deficit a problem
[3677.49-3681.81] in the others these are this particular emergency and also this political recycling or
[3681.81-3684.78] just i don't i think that it's no question that president trump is by
[3684.78-3689.04] far the most comfortable with the terrifying at tariffs as a tool both of
[3689.07-3693.06] you know economic and foreign policy that many of the others others president's may
[3693.06-3696.81] help and i mean their presence like president bush you you know probably wouldn't
[3696.81-3700.53] have nationally selected that particular to our method but if you go through all
[3700.53-3703.95] sixty nine of those intervening emergencies with they have not done at least as
[3703.95-3706.68] they have not identified with they say oh here's one were terrorists were going
[3706.68-3709.44] to ask the obvious to but the president didn't use used
[3711.12-3715.74] algonquin as you've mentioned many times is obviously very important here for us to
[3715.74-3721.47] understand exactly what's going on in algonquin the phrase there is different adjust imports
[3721.92-3724.86] and they they really the other side your friend on the other side really
[3724.86-3729.51] relies on the differences language and i just want you to to give your
[3729.51-3733.20] best to answer to why regulate importation
[3734.16-3736.65] encompasses tariffs
[3738.24-3742.23] you when and just we we held that adjust to imports what it would
[3742.23-3748.02] encompass money monetary exactions through three answer is if i may just is narrower
[3748.02-3754.65] than regulate and so therefore the selling or inclusive hours second answer adjust is
[3754.65-3759.03] the day is the second black small dictionary definition of regulate the blockchain didn't
[3759.03-3764.37] either our original play meeting dictionary definition says just by rule motor it rule
[3764.37-3769.35] method or establish mode so there's just a plain meaning link their regulate a
[3769.35-3772.80] just as a form of is kind of regulation and then i think far
[3772.80-3777.06] more importantly really the importation i can't emphasize enough going back to the time
[3777.06-3781.32] of the founding going back to the time founding has been understood that the
[3781.32-3785.13] manner in which you regulate importation the natural way to do that is to
[3785.13-3789.21] tariff so would be technically really astonishing given that historical pedigree going back to
[3789.21-3793.05] gibbons going back to you know madison's letter to back at all the historical
[3793.05-3796.62] sources cited are briefs it because of size you say hey present you can
[3796.65-3800.25] regularly imports but we're not saying this explicitly but you do not have the
[3800.25-3804.12] power to tear up when the the terrifying is the in many ways the
[3804.12-3810.09] quintessential we're regulating importation so is it that historical predatory pedigree sort of gives
[3810.09-3812.01] free been into that your friends
[3812.88-3819.18] and last on and some discussion about licence fee vs tariffs thursday six or
[3819.18-3820.32] in the council in
[3821.43-3825.63] in the were are you in algonquin said their own money's exacted on imports
[3825.63-3828.93] so in that sense it's shirley's a tariff and saw the incidents in the
[3828.93-3833.43] economic effect of a tariff but we can't rely on what the council said
[3833.46-3834.15] in algonquin
[3835.83-3838.29] isn't there a difference
[3839.37-3843.48] of sorts and least between a tear a license for you answer this i
[3843.48-3846.51] think briefly before but i want to make sure i think this could be
[3846.51-3850.26] an important point because i want to know algonquin to decide this case so
[3850.74-3854.25] given a fair shot on that i agree that there is maybe a minute
[3854.25-3858.09] there's a formal distinction but it as a practical matter i think what council
[3858.09-3860.76] was probably are you in areas that there really isn't much of an important
[3860.76-3864.66] distinction in i would point to the airport passage in algonquin where the courts
[3864.66-3868.74] as look they've conceded that this includes the power to quota it's it's quotas
[3868.74-3871.95] are quantitative mess it would make no sense for congress not to grab the
[3871.95-3875.43] qualitative method in all the more so here if there's a concession as they
[3875.43-3878.25] do in some of the read me a one time the court said monetary
[3878.25-3882.81] methods are you license fees from the next page said monetary exactions a license
[3882.81-3883.95] fees and duties
[3885.09-3888.39] think court bought these i'm going to be so that there's there's really not
[3888.39-3891.09] a lot of daylight between those two is pressure on that are certainly almost
[3891.09-3895.02] no daylight and so then the question that can you say almost no daylight
[3895.56-3895.95] just
[3897.18-3899.97] i mean i would say that their their economic equivalence legally
[3900.00-3903.63] they're pretty much the same so i really don't see a big distinction their
[3903.87-3908.76] intercourse that don't that the logic of algonquin was you can you know quantitative
[3908.76-3912.78] methods are quotas are allowed therefore would make no sense at all to interpret
[3912.78-3916.98] it's not to include qualitative or the that the monterey exemption methods well if
[3916.98-3920.25] you if we're talking about a distinction between regular deportation putting licenses that can
[3920.25-3925.23] come with fees but not terrorists that logic applies old think it makes no
[3925.23-3926.55] sense just spirit
[3927.54-3931.14] i think in algonquin there was a formal distinction that mattered because of that
[3931.14-3936.77] oral argument council pointed out that the uniformity cause woodwork kick in and the
[3936.77-3942.36] constitutional uniformity requirement would apply to tariffs if it was that way and speculated
[3942.36-3945.39] that the reason that the government may have set it up as a licensing
[3945.39-3949.08] scheme with licensing fees was to avoid that so i do think there are
[3949.08-3953.43] some distinctions but keeping that in mind if you say that there really is
[3953.43-3956.85] as a practical matter no difference this is kind of what i'm hung up
[3956.85-3960.81] on and lessons that maybe you can help so an ipa
[3961.62-3965.85] justice sotomayor as right licenses used as a noun but it's one of the
[3965.85-3971.34] means necessary so in algonquin it was by any means necessary adjust here the
[3971.34-3977.07] statute says the president may under such regulations as he may prescribe by means
[3977.07-3983.88] of instructions licenses or otherwise regulate importation which is the key part for our
[3983.88-3991.20] purposes so that means that specifies or instructions licenses or otherwise so i think
[3991.56-3996.00] it would only one argument might be that it would have been natural for
[3996.00-3996.96] congress to put
[3997.77-4004.43] the president made by means of instructions licenses tariffs or otherwise within a just
[4004.43-4008.24] and generous thing i think you have to rely on the are or otherwise
[4008.24-4012.86] picking up more or if there really is no practical difference between licenses and
[4012.86-4017.21] tariffs why are you making the argument or why didn't the president structure this
[4017.30-4018.83] as a licensing fees scheme
[4020.00-4023.33] how do i understand that language or it or am i just a misunderstanding
[4023.33-4027.23] and in this language is totally irrelevant i think that i usually respond when
[4027.56-4032.06] i think that language powerful reinforces our position where you buy it outright there
[4032.27-4039.14] because first of all regular importation we say in based on extensive historical pedigree
[4039.32-4042.77] the core application of them is to have to was terrifying again would have
[4042.77-4046.94] been essentially redundant not necessary especially if you look at the specific historical background
[4046.94-4052.07] tweel which we was inactive a terrific power or licensing like power that was
[4052.07-4056.15] described as again duties and terrorists equivalent okay but i don't understand because i
[4056.15-4061.25] think you have to put together a wand and then be so i think
[4061.25-4066.89] what you would be saying is he may prescribe by means of tariffs tariffs
[4067.34-4068.69] i think we're saying is by means of
[4069.53-4074.84] instruments licenses were the instructions lay that's says or otherwise destruction sharia what i
[4074.84-4079.79] was like sheriff otherwise about otherwise the if you say it is to instructions
[4079.79-4083.57] license or otherwise and we're sort of power that very very similar to a
[4083.57-4087.92] licensing otherwise naturally characters that with it with a former principal petition or pretty
[4088.19-4091.01] regular water usually means that okay i as we don't need to say it
[4091.01-4095.15] again however if you if congress authorized them to do it by licenses that
[4095.15-4098.56] could come with fees that are economically couldn't a terrorist and various doesn't mean
[4098.63-4102.94] wise it just reinforces the same conclusion that we get we used the phrase
[4102.94-4105.98] okay then to questions just so follow up on justice for such as thing
[4105.98-4110.03] about how can congress ever get this delegation back you said will listen you
[4110.03-4115.04] pointed the congress ability to terminate emergencies which it's done but if congress ever
[4115.04-4117.32] wanted to get the terrifying power back
[4118.13-4122.60] it would have to have a veto proof majority because regardless of emergency so
[4122.60-4126.35] if congress wanted to reject the and let's say that we adopt your interpretation
[4126.35-4130.82] of the statute of congress said whoa we don't like that that gives a
[4130.82-4135.50] president too much authority under ipa it's going to a very hard time pulling
[4135.53-4137.87] the tariff power outage vapor correct
[4139.52-4142.73] hard time shortly we have vetoed actually know what should be the true of
[4142.73-4146.49] any case we scored different of interpret interpreter statue yes i think that the
[4146.51-4149.54] but couldn't get jumped of in italy and and interpreting a statute that grants
[4149.54-4154.94] presidential power makes it particularly hard to get the president to not want to
[4154.94-4159.29] veto something which as justices pointing at justice course it just pointing out has
[4159.29-4160.52] him lose power
[4161.87-4165.14] i want to ask you a question about unusual an extraordinary threat which we
[4165.14-4168.47] have not talked about yet and i specifically want to talk about the reciprocal
[4168.47-4169.07] tariffs
[4170.00-4173.78] these are imposed on i mean these are kind of across the board and
[4173.78-4179.06] so is it your contention that every country needed to be terrified because of
[4179.06-4184.76] threats to the defense in industrial base and mean it spain france mean i
[4184.76-4189.11] could see it with some countries but explain to me why as many countries
[4189.11-4194.27] needed to be subject to the reciprocal terror of policy as are yeah executive
[4194.27-4199.16] order forty two five seven spells out the nature of the emergency and basically
[4199.16-4199.91] says that there's this
[4200.36-4205.49] there's sort of like a reciprocity this asymmetric tear to treatment or know our
[4205.49-4208.64] trade respect to foreign countries trade that does run across the board these a
[4208.67-4212.42] global problem i think that puts in context the argument they make it this
[4212.42-4214.85] power to tear for so broad because you're applying to every country in the
[4214.85-4219.41] world that conflates the nature of the tool terrifying which they are challenging here
[4219.56-4223.31] with the nature of the declared emergency which they have disputed they've been disputed
[4223.31-4228.02] for example of the president as correctly identify that virtually every major trading partner
[4228.23-4234.17] has this longstanding so asymmetric unfair treatment of of or trait so that they
[4234.17-4237.23] are going to this partial broaden our so broad is really based on a
[4237.24-4241.43] conflation of two different things one is the power right imagine that imagine that
[4241.43-4244.88] for example president reagan had want to judge you can confront south africa to
[4244.88-4249.20] change apartheid policies and he would post tariffs on them know about annihilation say
[4249.20-4252.08] well that's true broad that's too broad that can't be and i from the
[4252.08-4255.26] power to tear of is a sort of fits naturally with all those powers
[4255.26-4258.26] to block prohibited season so forth with they're showing this is so broad because
[4258.26-4262.48] the emergency is so broad but of course that's a presidential determination that in
[4262.48-4265.28] and there's all kinds of basis for it and also keep in mind of
[4265.28-4269.03] the emergency is not like just the asymmetric treatment it's the impact of a
[4269.03-4273.80] summit the underlying conditions the hollowing out of our manufacturing base yeah you know
[4273.80-4278.78] that the vulnerability of our supply chains and of course either that or defense
[4278.78-4283.22] industrial base this vulnerability of kicky and inputs just distraction to as i understand
[4283.25-4288.11] your response to just a spirit that last question you're saying that the power
[4288.11-4291.59] to tariff it's naturally with the power to block and sees that was your
[4291.59-4296.69] example but i guess i'm trying to understand been your argument from the text
[4296.72-4299.72] of the actual statute because the statute
[4300.86-4306.86] unlike what you suggested to justice kagan is focused on the actual actions that
[4306.86-4310.76] the president can take in response to justice kagan i understood you to say
[4310.76-4316.19] that congress was giving the president broad authority to act and it was with
[4316.19-4320.57] the in a particular domain which is the domain of emergencies with respect to
[4320.57-4324.50] foreign power but the president could basically do a lot of things but when
[4324.50-4329.15] i read the statue it is telling the president exactly what he can do
[4329.27-4335.92] investigate block during the pendant see of an investigation regulate direct and compel nullify
[4335.93-4340.46] boy prevent or prohibit and i guess what is a little concerning to me
[4340.46-4345.50] is that your argument suggest that we should see the word imposed the phrase
[4345.53-4350.57] impose tariffs in that same series of things that the president could do we
[4350.57-4355.40] don't see that word and instead you take regulate and say that must mean
[4355.40-4359.69] that so i guess i'm getting back to justice beer it's maybe original question
[4359.69-4366.92] which was where else in the code has congress use the word regulate to
[4366.92-4373.16] serbian for it impose tariffs trio and then this court opinions of course of
[4373.16-4377.42] use regulate and import or have point out that duties or the natural way
[4377.42-4380.93] to regulate for commerce but you're saying we should not have expected to see
[4380.93-4386.21] the same level of green hilarity with respect to the president's authority to impose
[4386.21-4393.38] tariffs as we see here investigate block directing compel nullify etc if you can
[4393.38-4397.34] be very unusual for congress to spell all the ways that you can regulate
[4397.37-4400.25] in that's to regulate becomes a big catch all the rest of the other
[4400.25-4402.68] things well i mean that we have a concession of that from the side
[4402.68-4405.80] that regular lease includes qualitative methods quantitative methods
[4406.61-4411.05] quangos licenses and if we can see that regulators lot of regulate that's not
[4411.05-4413.96] spelled out there and our point is you don't need to stop terrorists because
[4413.96-4416.75] that's like of all of them the most natural the most quintessential method of
[4416.75-4422.15] regulating and you'll get in and yet many many presidents have not used regulate
[4422.18-4425.96] in this way to impose tariffs i understand you pointed president nixon we have
[4425.96-4428.30] licenses from lincoln but
[4429.56-4433.79] there's no one else is kevin our presidents who are faced with international crises
[4433.79-4438.71] to which terrifying is that natural response that's president nixon and president trump haven't
[4438.71-4442.91] voters authority and also frankly president trump it represents or may have twenty nineteen
[4442.91-4445.46] as well can i have is one reason or play testing made that and
[4445.46-4448.07] they can see let me just ask one more question about
[4449.33-4449.90] be
[4450.92-4455.60] an unusual threat so in your conversation with just discourse age that we had
[4455.60-4462.20] the climate change terror hypo and you indicated that there would be challengers to
[4462.20-4467.42] the notion that that wasn't unusual an extraordinary threat and i'm just wondering under
[4467.42-4470.69] your position would they be able to make a legal challenge are you saying
[4470.96-4475.04] the court would not be able to review on that particular has an article
[4475.04-4477.56] that i think i said that the a question for congress so not a
[4477.95-4480.26] guy i don't i was that would be the sort of thing the quarter
[4480.26-4484.37] runaway to do is this really an emergency you know that would not be
[4484.79-4487.97] probably very unlikely that be a situation where at least they're their be very
[4487.97-4491.69] very very deferential judicial review of that kind of determination know i'm as it'll
[4491.69-4495.44] mess just those are two different things the is there no judicial review or
[4495.44-4499.01] is there deferential written for front line and trump against away from my position
[4499.01-4499.94] is that it wasn't
[4500.17-4503.51] to get specter it's committed it presents discretion when he makes his termination of
[4503.51-4508.07] a national emergency bought the court have to decide that because whatever review is
[4508.07-4511.04] very very deferential it's easily satisfied you thank you
[4512.12-4512.87] thank you council
[4519.20-4519.83] mr carter you
[4521.00-4525.32] thank you mister chief justice and way please the court tariffs our taxes they
[4525.32-4530.42] take dollars from americans pockets and deposit them in the us treasury or founders
[4530.42-4536.15] gave that taxing power to congress alone yet here the president bypass congress and
[4536.15-4541.76] imposed when the largest tax increases in our lifetimes many doctrines explain why this
[4541.76-4546.50] is illegal like the presumption that congress speaks clearly when it imposes taxes and
[4546.50-4551.99] duties and the major questions doctrine but it comes down to common sense it
[4552.00-4556.73] simply implausible that an an acting or uber congress handed the president the power
[4556.73-4561.95] to overhaul the entire tariffs system and the american economy in the process allowing
[4561.95-4566.00] him to set in reset terrorists on any and every product from any and
[4566.00-4570.65] every country at any and all times and as justice coursage and burgess said
[4570.83-4574.73] this is a one way ratchet we will never get this power back if
[4574.73-4580.55] the government wins this case what president wouldn't be beto legislation terrain this power
[4580.55-4584.93] in and pull out the terror of power and iba is a sanction statute
[4585.08-4589.91] it's not a tax statue were congress gave away the store congress knows exactly
[4589.91-4593.45] how to delegate it's terror of powers every time for two hundred and thirty
[4593.45-4598.97] eight years it's done so explicitly always with real limits are cheaper looks nothing
[4598.97-4604.55] like those laws uses regulate which congress has used hundreds of times never once
[4604.55-4609.41] to include tariffs and lacks the limits of every other of statue and that
[4609.41-4614.63] is why even though presidents have used ipa to impose economic sanctions thousands of
[4614.63-4619.58] times no president and a bus fifty your lifetime has ever try to impose
[4619.58-4625.04] tariffs and the president bypass statutes that do address tariffs like section one twenty
[4625.04-4629.51] two for a large and serious trade deficits but that imposes a clear guard
[4629.51-4634.31] rail fifteen percent cap one hundred and fifty day limit this is youngstown at
[4634.31-4640.13] it's lowest lab that if the government wins another president could declare climate emergency
[4640.31-4645.20] and impose huge tariffs without fines or without floors or ceilings is justice courts
[4645.20-4651.35] it's that my friends answer this administration were declared a hoax next president may
[4651.35-4655.73] not quite say that this is an open ended power to junk the tariff
[4655.73-4660.50] laws and is certainly not conveyed by the by the word regulate i welcome
[4660.50-4661.55] the courts questions
[4663.01-4668.60] wouldn't you argument also apply to embargoes so in this was the argument and
[4668.63-4672.68] the define descend term below and i think there are three answers to that
[4672.68-4679.19] justice thomas the first is revenue raising embargoes stop the shipment terror of start
[4679.19-4683.42] the tax bill the or first and foremost ways of regulating revenue is some
[4683.42-4687.20] of your own opinion said this is the way we actually chiefly got revenue
[4687.20-4693.17] for the first hundred years of our republic terrorists and cars constitutionally special because
[4693.17-4697.79] or cup founders feared revenue raising on like embargoes and then you know there
[4697.79-4702.71] was no boston embargo party but there was certainly a boston tea party the
[4702.71-4708.38] second thing tax julie in the statue it's different regulate appears in a cluster
[4708.38-4712.85] of verbs as was said before investigate block nullify in the like they described
[4712.85-4718.13] embargo like controls prevent and prohibit for example there but they don't describe revenue
[4718.13-4723.68] exactions that's justice kagan point the one verb that's missing here is anything about
[4723.71-4730.64] raven raising revenue whatsoever another point congressional displacement today there is a whole host
[4730.64-4736.73] of statutes in the tariff architecture of title nineteen which both expressly confer the
[4736.73-4742.10] power to tariff and always implodes could impose clear limits embargoes by the president
[4742.10-4746.03] embargoes don't have any of that they don't set aside that whole thing if
[4746.03-4749.84] you look at the learning resources brief it page five it goes through these
[4749.84-4755.54] statutes in detail section one twenty two expressly says duties and then limited fifteen
[4755.54-4760.16] percent hundred fifty days section two or one any duty on the important article
[4760.31-4764.96] but it requires i t c findings section three oh on impose duties that's
[4764.96-4769.58] a language of the statute but all sorts of procedural restrictions section three thirty
[4769.58-4772.25] eight the same i didn't go through this and i could start by the
[4772.25-4776.72] way justice thomas with the statutes at the founding all of which expressly said
[4776.72-4778.34] the word terror for an equivalent
[4779.75-4785.36] let's go back to your nine delegation point on it would seem that
[4786.23-4787.25] if it's on
[4788.24-4794.00] if if the powered terrapower cannot be delegated your argument or non delegation also
[4794.00-4799.25] have to apply to embargoes and to quotas know your honor because i think
[4799.25-4799.94] terrorists speak
[4800.06-4805.64] has their uniquely revenue raising and special unique concerns that go back to our
[4805.64-4809.81] founding in so i don't think that they apply to embargoes and indeed it
[4809.84-4813.38] history of this is very good very clear that as you just heard my
[4813.38-4818.87] friends say and seventeen ninety george washington was delegated massive embargo power from the
[4818.87-4822.32] congress but what if congress not to in this is why the example cuts
[4822.32-4826.73] the other way they never gave the president any sort of delegation of tariff
[4826.73-4830.72] authority of the time or point is not you can't delegate terrific already it's
[4830.72-4835.01] simply that you've gotta do so with intelligible principles and what you just heard
[4835.01-4840.08] my friends say is every single limit in ipa is one that is not
[4840.08-4845.00] traditionally enforceable there's no limit whatsoever and indeed the main limit that was in
[4845.00-4849.74] there he causes some compromise position the only compromise and nineteen seventy seven was
[4849.74-4854.03] the legislative veto and as this case comes to the cork that's no longer
[4854.18-4859.10] in the statute at all how so the you yes church the terrorists are
[4859.73-4864.59] attacks and that's cool power of congress but there are foreign facing tax right
[4864.95-4870.17] that foreign affairs court power of the executive and i don't think you can
[4870.17-4875.30] dismiss the consequences i mean we didn't stay this case in one thing is
[4875.72-4880.82] why clear is that the for and facing terrorists tariffs haven't service which right
[4880.82-4882.29] and we aren't your and i'm sorry but
[4883.13-4887.30] we're quite effective in achieving particular objective so
[4888.23-4891.29] i i don't think you can just separated when you say well this is
[4891.29-4897.71] attacks congress's power it implicate very directly the president's foreign affairs power mister chief
[4897.71-4900.86] justice were no we don't disagree with a large part of that we think
[4900.86-4904.58] instead of thinking about foreign vs domestic the better way of thinking about it
[4904.58-4909.95] as article one vs article to and as my friend finally conceded to justice
[4909.95-4914.24] course such there is no article to power here at least when we're talking
[4914.24-4917.39] about peace time where you can all agree with a large part of what's
[4917.39-4920.69] to little part that you do do so we we we agree we agree
[4920.69-4925.70] with the idea that terrorists have foreign policy implications absolutely our founders recognize that
[4925.70-4932.27] that's in the federalist papers but nonetheless they exclusively committed that power to the
[4932.27-4936.11] congress and article one section eight and gave it has it's first power so
[4936.11-4940.19] when you hear my friend site cases like egan and garamendi they just don't
[4940.19-4945.26] apply to this specific unique situation and which congress has given that power and
[4945.26-4948.08] if you are tempted by this i think it i think the best place
[4948.08-4952.37] to look is youngstown because what justice jackson said and i was surprised that
[4952.37-4955.64] he quoted pages six fifty two because we just as jackson said his quote
[4955.91-4960.71] emergency powers tend to kindle emergencies so it's essential the public may know the
[4960.71-4965.96] extent and limitations of the powers that can be asserted and person's affected may
[4965.96-4970.49] be informed from the statute of it's rights and duties and just as jackson
[4970.49-4975.26] went on to say their that it's notable our founders didn't give the up
[4975.26-4979.04] a bit akin to give the president revenue bracing power even a time of
[4979.04-4982.58] war can i just get a clarification of your answer which is
[4983.48-4987.20] you agree if the word terror of were in the statute that would be
[4987.53-4993.80] acceptable unconstitutionally permissible correct know it well it it would be a be constitutionally
[4993.80-4999.77] permissible the question would then be is the open ended assertion of power here
[4999.77-5002.50] because every either i get it as a little i do this case but
[5002.50-5009.19] the general point is yes congress you said society congress but congress can grant
[5009.28-5015.57] authority to president's to impose tariffs ship such as a general proposition okay swift
[5015.57-5020.71] to figure out and wrote what regulate importation means and you've heard my questions
[5020.71-5023.83] of the it's this statue came out of nowhere in nineteen seventy seven
[5024.82-5026.53] figure case would be you know
[5028.21-5031.87] obviously stronger we have to figure out at least i want to figure out
[5031.87-5036.55] what the nixon president stands for and what algonquin students for on the next
[5036.64-5041.38] president the question is a thing was congress aware of that meaning that when
[5041.38-5046.30] they used regulate importation and it's now being used to compass tariffs that's not
[5046.30-5053.38] unheralded because congress was well aware president nixon announced those tariffs and a nationwide
[5053.41-5056.02] prime time speech ten percent
[5057.25-5061.00] across the board in august nineteen seventy one it was not some kind of
[5061.45-5065.80] little piece of paper says well known the question then is was congress why
[5065.80-5069.76] didn't they change the language why did they say regulate but not terrorists that's
[5070.03-5073.78] kind of the difficult question from the next president that i'll give you an
[5073.78-5079.00] opportunity think you just cabin also five answers on the next and precedent first
[5079.24-5083.92] there is no evidence that congress thought it was ratifying yoshida was a single
[5083.92-5088.30] court of appeals case it's not some want my question i never mention yoshida
[5088.39-5094.09] it's the use by the president of that power under regulate important important if
[5094.09-5098.77] we're just talking about that president nixon did not rely on the statute whatsoever
[5099.01-5099.97] amazing that's very
[5100.03-5103.66] clear in fact we have a marshall mcluhan moment here because you have before
[5103.66-5107.59] you alan wolf the person who was there in the room with nixon saying
[5107.77-5112.54] nixon totally disagreed that the statute applied so if we're just talking about nixon
[5112.72-5115.33] i don't think it that the the africa were going to your other for
[5115.42-5119.14] you rather for i think the only way it does any work is if
[5119.14-5123.55] the president is through the the vehicle of yoshida and that's what i take
[5123.55-5128.56] it of the government is arguing and with respect to that this cert denied
[5128.56-5132.73] intermediate court of appeals decision i don't think and come close to overcoming the
[5132.73-5138.91] clear plain text the word regulate is rewards regulate importation the word regulate has
[5138.91-5142.81] never been used it's been it's the congress uses the term fourteen hundred ninety
[5142.81-5145.84] nine times forgot about that number of hits when we looked at it and
[5145.84-5151.69] maybe there's some double counting but it is never used even once to impose
[5151.69-5155.47] taxes or revenue raising and that was the question that just a spare was
[5155.47-5159.67] asking and so i don't think that this intermediate court of appeals decision will
[5159.67-5164.05] get you there and then even if you thought that congress and knew about
[5164.05-5169.00] yoshida in even to be something like that which there's absolutely zero evidence of
[5169.51-5172.90] i don't think that helps the government for reasons that justice alito was pointing
[5172.90-5178.63] to because yoshida said three things a tweet doesn't give the unlimited authority that
[5178.63-5183.13] the government is seeking here be they were only upholding the lid the limited
[5183.13-5189.19] specific assertion of authority that president nixon sought there and third going forward the
[5189.19-5193.96] solution they said and photo thirty three was to use section one twenty two
[5193.96-5198.25] of the nineteen seventy four trade act fifteen percent hundred and fifty days we
[5198.25-5202.33] have no problem with the president doing that is just that this president has
[5202.33-5207.79] torn up the entire tariff architecture you know for example he's terrifying switzerland one
[5207.79-5212.71] of our allies which we have a trade surplus thirty nine percent that is
[5212.72-5217.15] just not something that any president has ever had the power to do in
[5217.15-5222.40] our history and the idea that congress by implication did this and nineteen seventy
[5222.40-5226.82] seven and handed him all this power i think it's really difficult to static
[5226.84-5228.76] and all go have the
[5230.32-5236.23] just as let's start with just the bare statutory language you have arguments about
[5236.23-5238.90] structure you have arguments about history
[5239.95-5240.58] there are
[5241.63-5249.61] strong arguments but let's just start with the bear statutory language regulate importation if
[5249.61-5254.80] we disregard all of the rest would you dispute that would include the imposition
[5254.86-5259.27] of a fee so if it's revenue or yeah we do with dispute that
[5259.27-5263.59] absolutely what is there were a statute that said meme suppose that there's particular
[5263.59-5268.12] national park that's very crowded and congress passed the statute that says a national
[5268.12-5272.50] park service may regulate admission to the park would you say well that does
[5272.50-5276.97] not allow them to impose of the so you know your and sometimes we
[5276.97-5281.17] think a fees is not revenue raising but rather capturing the cost of government
[5281.17-5285.79] services in your example the going to the park on that made the you
[5285.79-5289.66] know those kinds of cases which you think the president was beyond the the
[5289.75-5290.44] the cost
[5291.67-5292.69] of running the park
[5293.74-5298.75] cars just wants to control admission to the park regulated mission with that include
[5298.75-5303.67] the imposition of the sea so if if it doesn't raise revenue that in
[5303.67-5307.21] is this not about that and i think that's fine if it don't read
[5307.24-5311.17] it raises revenue that and i think it's that have hypothetical that wouldn't that
[5311.17-5315.04] wouldn't apply so i think i think in that circumstance that it wouldn't be
[5315.07-5319.66] a regulation and context in wouldn't be permitted that is at least in the
[5319.66-5324.04] context of tariffs and trade we know justice alito all that sand gets into
[5324.04-5328.52] your other arguments we start out with the bear slashed were language
[5330.91-5334.54] as that was what my question was about do you think all terrorists or
[5334.54-5336.88] revenue raising suppose that
[5337.69-5340.33] instead of imposing these
[5341.17-5343.66] these across the board tariffs
[5344.53-5345.73] suppose that
[5346.72-5351.91] an executive order imposed a tariff on one particular country
[5353.14-5360.97] and provided that this would take effect in ninety days and suppose that within
[5360.97-5366.04] those ninety days in agreement is reached with that country so that no tariff
[5366.31-5371.29] no no tariff is ever collected with mp a revenue raising term i take
[5371.29-5375.52] it the initial point one of and on it's face it is revenue raising
[5375.64-5379.03] that that's what it's for and so i think that would and work i
[5379.03-5382.90] don't doubt that are edge cases that is what this court's confronted just recently
[5382.90-5387.34] and fcc vs consumer research and you said look what is attacks is sometimes
[5387.34-5391.78] very hard what is revenue raising this is obviously revenue raising their own brief
[5391.78-5396.52] to the court says it's going to raise four trillion dollars and justice alito
[5396.52-5400.00] you and your consumers research descent so you're just scores
[5400.00-5405.49] the descent a huge oil and said taxation is special indifferent and be it
[5405.51-5410.53] is the most powerful thing the government does and the idea that congress where
[5410.53-5415.12] they know exactly how to write tariff and tax statutes gave this power by
[5415.12-5419.89] implication through the word regulate i think is very very hard a huge you
[5419.89-5427.06] cite many different statutory provisions that impose tariffs and and you have a point
[5427.09-5432.55] if that's the relevant universe what if the relevant universe verse is tariffs that
[5432.55-5438.55] are imposed in emergency situations yes so i think it cuts the other way
[5438.58-5442.24] so you know is just as jackson said bit when you're in an emergency
[5442.24-5447.04] situation the statutes actually have to speak with more precision the public needs to
[5447.04-5452.53] know because emergencies be get emergencies and i would say the best way of
[5452.53-5458.47] understanding what congress doesn't emergencies is to look at their emergency statutes not one
[5458.71-5463.08] has ever given the president a taxation power or a terror of power we've
[5463.08-5467.26] had all sorts of emergencies for two hundred and thirty eight years no president
[5467.26-5470.11] has ever said oh the way to deal with that as i need to
[5470.11-5474.88] have a tariff authority and it's just a sotomayor said i gives already a
[5474.88-5478.99] quota power so you can get what the foreign policy piece of it is
[5478.99-5483.58] through that i'd also say justice alito games and more which the chief justice
[5483.91-5488.56] refer to earlier i think it's really important here because the solicitor general in
[5488.56-5492.67] that case made a similar argument to what you just hurt either and on
[5492.67-5498.34] the claims provisions he said it falls within regulate regulators the capacious term he
[5498.34-5502.51] said justice alito what you said this is an emergency situation and he said
[5502.51-5506.47] you've got to defer to the president on a major issue of national security
[5506.68-5511.75] about this very statue and what did the court do it rejected those arguments
[5511.75-5514.69] and said i eat but doesn't come from because you say that this is
[5514.69-5521.05] not this case does not have these executive orders to hot address can unusual
[5521.11-5525.64] an extraordinary threat i understand that argument suppose that
[5527.29-5532.66] the facts were that it was in display suppose that there was an imminent
[5532.66-5533.71] threat of war
[5535.03-5540.55] declared war but an imminent threat of war with a very powerful enemy who's
[5540.55-5547.69] economy was heavily dependent on us trade could a president under this provision impose
[5547.78-5552.70] a tariff as way of trying to stave off that war would you say
[5552.70-5557.68] no president lacks that power couldn't teach her africa do quota embargo all of
[5557.68-5562.42] those things going on while those things but the president could not impose dancers
[5562.42-5567.16] acquiring couldn't do there's a category shift between a tariff and the other eight
[5567.19-5571.08] powers in a part because it is revenue raising so it's not a difference
[5571.09-5574.81] and degree or something like that that's why you know i don't doubt to
[5575.05-5579.16] even the purpose of this was had nothing whatsoever to do with raising one
[5579.16-5583.18] penny the president didn't want to raise one penny the president wanted to deter
[5583.21-5586.93] aggression that would bring the united states two words i would say no can't
[5586.93-5590.08] do that there's just delete i think you've said many times the purpose isn't
[5590.11-5593.32] what you look at you look to actually worth the government is doing and
[5593.32-5596.53] if you disagree if you think we're you know if you think it really
[5596.53-5600.22] irks me if if if you wrote for us and the president says i
[5600.22-5604.06] need this power he can go to go across the street to congress tomorrow
[5604.06-5608.71] in get it by a simple majority through reconciliation but if you vote for
[5608.71-5613.84] them this power as justice course it said is just as parents said is
[5613.84-5617.08] gonna be stuck with us forever the powered it should i ask you have
[5617.14-5617.71] a look at
[5620.17-5623.14] i just wanted to give you a chance to dress kind of the other
[5623.14-5627.37] argument that it's been submerged here to actually again just bear text for a
[5627.37-5628.06] moment okay
[5629.50-5634.90] we've been focused on regulate importation but actually the statue says the president made
[5635.35-5643.72] by means of licenses or otherwise regulate importation and we've had some discussion today
[5643.72-5644.95] about the fact that
[5646.12-5651.19] maybe the president could simply we characterize these tariffs them as licenses were were
[5651.31-5652.98] or rejigger the that the
[5653.96-5659.05] the scheme so that they are licenses have also heard the suggestion that otherwise
[5659.98-5664.81] you know licenses and and and tariffs are very similar so otherwise might encompass
[5664.81-5669.64] tariffs their thoughts yeah a few thoughts are just as coursage first is either
[5669.64-5673.03] the sg is not even making that argument and i think they're not making
[5673.03-5677.35] it for a number of reasons one is that there's a strong presumption against
[5677.35-5682.42] reading statutes this way in the unique tax and duties context are trump is
[5682.57-5686.69] one of those cases which says if there's doubt you don't read the statute
[5686.69-5691.27] to confer such powers second if he were to do that it's open ended
[5691.27-5695.74] it allows and this is your hypothetical it allows under the word license them
[5695.74-5700.00] to tariff the world you know and seems like you're putting a me
[5700.09-5705.19] your questions thumb or an interpretive lens thumb on the plain text there's a
[5705.21-5708.49] fair i think it's i think you could call him major questions i just
[5708.49-5712.21] think it's like just as barracks said in nebraska vs biden the most natural
[5712.21-5717.10] way of understanding what the statute is about we're talking about under the government's
[5717.10-5721.92] reading a statute that gives the power to the president to junk the entire
[5721.92-5726.67] area i understand that but you're not disputing licenses or otherwise means what it
[5726.67-5731.92] says you're you're you're saying we should interpret that narrowly for particular reasons so
[5731.98-5735.19] i think you will idea i'm disputing it is well i think the licenses
[5735.19-5739.84] in the something just sotomayor were saying don't expand the power they are not
[5739.84-5743.71] verbs and so it is limited to the nine verbs there i understand and
[5743.71-5745.22] so regulate i don't thank you
[5746.17-5748.24] thank you counts with fists thompson true that
[5750.31-5755.42] i'd like to just revisit the point that justice alito was baking i'm with
[5755.42-5757.18] the a similar question
[5758.77-5763.39] if one of our major trading partners that's for example china
[5764.50-5767.11] held a us citizen hostage
[5768.55-5774.10] could the president short of in bar going or setting quotas said the most
[5774.10-5780.31] effective way to gain leverage is to impose a tariff for the purpose of
[5780.82-5787.09] leveraging his position to recover our hostage know you're on earth so tariffs are
[5787.09-5790.84] different because their revenue raising and there's and i think it goes to the
[5790.84-5794.29] point i was saying to you and are very first colloquia which is quotas
[5794.29-5798.43] and burgers and stuff for different for different reasons which users and know there's
[5798.43-5804.58] a tariff architecture around title nineteen and title nineteen that and terrorists would like
[5804.58-5809.26] in your hypothetical would supersede and here the president is seeking the power to
[5809.26-5814.51] set aside all of our trade treaties unilaterally fall under the word regular i
[5814.51-5816.52] just don't think it can bear that wait
[5819.25-5821.50] to sicily don't you mentioned
[5822.40-5826.30] other tariff provisions that you think would be rendered
[5827.29-5833.86] redundant if we adopted the government's interpretation of you buy one that you didn't
[5833.86-5839.05] mention which is disgusting an amicus brief is section three thirty eight of the
[5839.06-5846.91] tower fact nineteen thirty why doesn't plain language of that provision which does speak
[5846.97-5849.70] specifically about duties
[5851.32-5855.70] provide a basis for all are virtually all of the tariffs that are at
[5855.70-5859.12] issue here yeah the government's and ever made that argument justice alito and i
[5859.12-5864.58] think for very good reason because it only applies to mf and violations which
[5864.58-5868.18] are not at issue here you can only tariff if the president quote finds
[5868.18-5873.25] is a fact that a country satisfies to conditions including that it discriminates against
[5873.25-5876.85] the united states are also it's a host of other reasons why section three
[5876.85-5880.48] thirty eight may have lapsed and that's why no president has ever used it
[5880.72-5884.44] but look what is the but is the argument that it's lapsed it's it's
[5884.71-5889.57] regrettable and we put this case someone very expedited schedule and therefore there are
[5889.57-5890.83] limitations on what
[5892.07-5896.20] the party's ability to answer each other's arguments are arguments that are made by
[5896.20-5896.62] miki
[5897.91-5903.01] the the amicus brief says that it hasn't lapsed there are articles that say
[5903.01-5907.45] it hasn't lamps what is your argument with is the basis for your argument
[5907.45-5910.54] that it last so to think just so you know section it's to fifty
[5910.54-5915.04] two and three or one have been understood by many to of superseded section
[5915.04-5918.28] three thirty eight and second i don't think you have to get into this
[5918.28-5921.55] issue at all we're not here saying that the government doesn't have a three
[5921.55-5925.15] thirty three thirty eight power that's something that can be decided by other courts
[5925.15-5928.51] at other times as these folks come to the court does the government comes
[5928.51-5932.98] to the court today they're citing one statute in one statute only ipa and
[5932.98-5938.65] we submit to you it doesn't come even close to authorizing these worldwide terrorists
[5938.65-5940.90] that well what if the president tomorrow
[5941.92-5942.79] we're to say
[5943.81-5949.09] i'm reissuing these executive orders and and i'm invoking in addition to other authorities
[5949.09-5952.72] section three thirty eight of the tariff act so eighteen thirty
[5953.53-5956.14] i think at that point we'd have that case i mean i'm not here
[5956.14-5960.10] to say that three thirty eight does or doesn't to one thing i'm responding
[5960.10-5964.42] to the government's argument which is the invocation of i iba in a alone
[5964.60-5969.97] but perhaps that point justice alito middle again economy and i understand party presentation
[5969.97-5974.86] and and all that and not being a court of first view but in
[5974.86-5977.05] these circumstances if that were to happen
[5977.86-5983.65] and it might be a realistic possibility you think well okay then the government
[5983.65-5986.14] would continue to try to collect these tariffs and
[5987.64-5991.33] the plaintiffs here would have to go back to the court of international trade
[5991.33-5995.41] or the district court and challenge it again and it would have to progress
[5995.71-5999.52] through those lower courts and come back to us when a year from now
[5999.61-5999.91] six
[6000.06-6005.10] months from now while the tariffs continue to be collected and name out that's
[6005.10-6005.85] at stake
[6006.90-6011.76] melts into the billions i mean what are we at now hundred billion get
[6011.76-6016.17] up to up to a trillion that's what your suggestions so justice alito i
[6016.17-6019.44] think a few things one is i think it's rich for the government to
[6019.44-6024.54] be making this argument about the refunds undermining us because they oppose the preliminary
[6024.54-6028.59] injunction in this case by saying oh don't worry we'll give the refunds later
[6028.80-6032.70] and they saw to stay in the federal circuit on exactly that ground which
[6032.70-6036.00] was you don't need to do you don't need to implement the federal circuit's
[6036.00-6040.11] decision because will give the refunds later on and now they're suggesting that really
[6040.11-6044.67] wasn't that wasn't like question mister hale and the question was whether it would
[6044.67-6048.93] make more sense for us to address that if that is a possible justification
[6048.93-6053.34] for these terrorists for us to address that now and get it over with
[6053.34-6058.17] rather than having this continue for who knows how long will it goes through
[6058.17-6062.10] the through the procedures in the lower court justice alito i think of this
[6062.10-6066.18] forfeit forfeited nine ways to sunday the sammich as brief has been filed in
[6066.18-6070.50] every single stage of this case the government's never embrace that argument for them
[6070.50-6073.95] to be able to do so now i think is is way way too
[6073.95-6078.33] late but i do think if you ruled as were suggesting you do against
[6078.33-6082.26] the government they can go and try and seek to use other authorities whether
[6082.26-6087.18] it's three thirty eight section one twenty two etc those are the ways prescribed
[6087.18-6091.14] by the congress and it's just us capital i was saying earlier every other
[6091.14-6096.39] president has used all this sweet of other authorities to or one for steel
[6096.39-6100.50] for for autos and things like that three or one for countries like china
[6100.80-6105.09] this president has come along and said something different and with all due respect
[6105.09-6108.18] we don't think i eat out the him to do this chunking of the
[6108.18-6110.91] worldwide turf architect and work was the view
[6112.05-6119.07] what were the views of president trump's immediate predecessors on the question of imposing
[6119.07-6124.41] tariffs or allowing free trade what was their policy you on that question there's
[6124.41-6128.88] been a variety of different views about that but it you know the executive
[6128.88-6134.13] order it my friend said well prior presidents had no occasion to use the
[6134.13-6139.20] tariff power which is belied by the very executive order he's defending here which
[6139.20-6144.18] says that the trade deficit of in large and persistent every single quarter since
[6144.18-6149.37] nineteen seventy six and we've had trade wars president reagan initiative initiated you know
[6149.37-6153.66] different ones and the use of different authorities but never once did a president
[6153.66-6158.58] try and seek a iba as the basis to rewrite the entire tariff code
[6160.44-6162.69] i sounded interesting to hear you make the
[6163.53-6169.62] non delegation argument circuit i wonder if you ever thought that your legacy is
[6169.67-6171.81] constitutional advocate would be
[6172.71-6179.37] the man who revived the non delegation argument heck yes justice alito i think
[6179.37-6182.52] just as course such nailed it on the head when saying that when you're
[6182.52-6187.68] dealing with a statute said the that is this open ended unlike anything we've
[6187.68-6191.76] ever seen to give the president this kind of power yes this isn't just
[6191.76-6195.99] delegation running riot this is delegation that's a legislative i wouldn't you wouldn't you
[6195.99-6203.67] agree that statutes that for the president real emergency powers are often phrased much
[6203.67-6209.28] more broadly than other statutes is that the very nature of an emergency i
[6209.28-6212.34] know you dispute the fact that this is a real emergency maybe it's not
[6212.58-6217.44] but isn't that the very nature of an emergency provision that is gonna be
[6217.56-6218.58] more open and
[6219.42-6223.23] so justice alito we think it actually cuts the other way as i was
[6223.23-6227.79] saying earlier that's what justice jackson said and you know you already confronted that
[6227.79-6231.00] and games and more and said it's not that open ended even though it's
[6231.00-6236.04] an emergency and by the way other emergency statutes have very serious limit section
[6236.04-6242.04] one twenty two is literally about president nixon's proclamation of in emergency that's what
[6242.04-6245.58] it's about and it's limited fifteen percent hundred and fifty days and what about
[6245.58-6249.96] the authorization for the use of military force in two thousand large gave the
[6249.96-6254.16] president the power to use all appropriate force
[6254.97-6259.08] and that's pretty open ended you would you apply the same
[6260.16-6260.91] the same
[6262.17-6266.73] non delegation argument there that you do here of course not because they're you
[6266.73-6270.84] have shared powers between the president and article one and article two pairs of
[6270.85-6274.35] sort of saying well it gets into the question of whether it was delegated
[6274.35-6278.10] or what was the scope of the delegation absolutely but done but there you
[6278.10-6282.48] know it's military there's a whole unique history behind that but here you're talking
[6282.48-6288.84] about something that is exclusively committed to congress and article one and their yes
[6288.84-6292.50] when you have delegations of say just sort of even when you have delegations
[6292.50-6297.06] and some military cases an emergency statutes they have all sorts of limit so
[6297.06-6299.94] say so ten see twenty eight oh wait says
[6300.00-6305.55] the declaration of war or a national emergency the president can quote undertake military
[6305.55-6310.32] construction necessary to support emergency using the armed forces you my it has limits
[6311.28-6311.94] the sooner
[6313.02-6319.89] i'm fascinated that the two instances where a president said use the a war
[6319.89-6320.64] powers
[6321.75-6325.59] to impose a tariff lincoln and nixon
[6326.43-6332.52] that congress found it necessary to ratify their actions and that the court in
[6332.52-6335.25] both those cases the intermediate
[6336.56-6340.17] court of appeals in nixon an hour on court
[6342.75-6349.08] included that as part of their reasoning as justifying the use of war power
[6349.08-6352.08] in that situation so i'm a little
[6353.04-6359.85] concerned why the fact that this act a domestic act on emergency that uses
[6359.85-6365.55] a word a general word like regulate should take on a war powers meaning
[6366.48-6373.17] when in every other situation whenever congress intended domestic texas taxation it's a tax
[6373.17-6376.80] and regulate of justice or tomorrow wish i had an hour to talk about
[6376.80-6380.25] this with you because this is just this argument by the government advanced in
[6380.26-6384.12] the reply brief is wrong to you know every which way the i'm saying
[6384.12-6388.89] that's another that's your six way of differentiating cedar correction so that was a
[6388.89-6393.72] war powers case to wheels we it's a war powers case about conquered territory
[6393.90-6397.20] it has nothing to do whatsoever with domestic terrorists
[6398.04-6402.66] and absolutely you're right in saying that the way that court even in those
[6402.66-6407.01] cases even at the height of the government's power war powers they said congress
[6407.01-6410.13] had to ratify it and that's what of page ninety six and that hasn't
[6410.13-6413.37] happened to you now has not happened here not even close will it might
[6413.37-6414.87] not we congress close but
[6415.83-6419.85] they can't even think about it right now i'm gonna assume and maybe he
[6419.85-6424.44] can shake his head yes or no that justice of cabin or will ask
[6424.44-6429.51] you to go to algonquin which you didn't answer and v shaking his head
[6429.81-6434.43] so let him do that part okay excellent algonquin your honor is i you
[6434.43-6436.53] know i know i'll let him do it over
[6438.81-6441.90] he can his question but i want to make sure you get to it
[6442.05-6444.09] will hear from justice kagan first
[6445.35-6449.40] i have one specific question one more general question the specific question is
[6450.72-6454.35] does it matter in the way we think about a year or what congress
[6454.35-6457.50] thought it was doing and i uber what what are you but in fact
[6457.53-6462.33] did that at the time congress thought it had available to it a legislative
[6462.33-6462.72] veto
[6463.74-6468.82] i do think it's relevant at least for delegation purposes because you know who
[6468.82-6472.80] is this case comes to the court the one check that was in their
[6472.89-6477.69] the so called compromise is a legislative her which now no longer exists and
[6477.69-6481.50] that's why i said of justice alito this statue now looks on like any
[6481.50-6485.79] other statute with respect i guess i'm wondering whether though it cuts again steel
[6485.79-6489.69] as well that congress thought it had a legislative vetoes so didn't put in
[6489.99-6493.71] a variety of checks that it might have put in i had it not
[6493.71-6497.73] thought it had a legislative veto and you know that's just tough luck on
[6497.73-6501.27] congress now yeah i don't think so mean justice kagan i think it's a
[6501.27-6506.25] very tough common sense argument to make because every single to delegation of terror
[6506.26-6511.35] of stand tara parents statute from congress to the president always has limits and
[6511.35-6516.57] including you know section one twenty two past just right before ipa had in
[6516.60-6521.34] the case of exact problem that this executive orders dealing with large and serious
[6521.34-6525.27] trade deficit said the way to deal with it is fifteen percent hundred and
[6525.27-6529.74] fifty days the idea that three years later they just said oh no junk
[6529.74-6533.52] the rulebook i think is very difficult to know congress i think what will
[6533.52-6537.90] i just on the legislative veto for such a thing of such momentous importance
[6538.11-6542.52] as you said to my colleagues earlier why would any president look to the
[6542.58-6546.51] look to all of the different her statutes and title nineteen if you can
[6546.51-6551.91] just i eat them all french revolution them all and general sour rests a
[6551.91-6556.74] lot on the president's inherent authority and i want to make sure i understand
[6556.74-6561.30] your answer to that chief justice and to justice alito as to where you
[6561.30-6566.43] think that authority exists in a way that actually would affect our interpretation of
[6566.43-6570.27] a statute and where you think it doesn't and why this falls into the
[6570.27-6577.38] second category given that in general sours view and this is obviously what that
[6577.38-6581.24] chief justice colored foreign face and yeah so maybe for and facing but there
[6581.24-6586.74] are still no article to power whatsoever there is no citation whatsoever in the
[6586.74-6592.50] government's brief to any notion that the president has article to turf authority and
[6592.58-6597.54] look i will say in wartime conquer territory maybe but this is not a
[6597.66-6599.94] car there's not a wartime er conquered terror
[6600.03-6604.32] for statute this is where the use of the statute they are terrifying the
[6604.32-6608.91] entire world in peace time and they are doing it new the asserting a
[6608.92-6613.56] power that know president in our histories ever had been just as capitalise example
[6613.56-6618.84] of nixon really far more limited didn't blow past congress has limits as was
[6618.84-6623.70] said and yoshida this is a whole different animal and maybe congress has that
[6623.70-6626.79] power as i agree with just as course which i don't think that it
[6626.79-6631.65] does but boy they gotta say so really clearly and here there's nothing like
[6631.65-6634.95] that in the text of aber they can just as course which
[6636.48-6639.09] i don't know if i agree with what you say i say but a
[6639.09-6639.36] rate
[6641.91-6643.53] that back to the plain language
[6644.34-6647.58] and it just stick with me for a moment you know with the that
[6647.58-6654.60] the the constitution says that congress gets to regulate commerce and everybody understood that
[6654.60-6659.52] meant and included the power to tariff story madison okay
[6660.72-6665.79] so that that sort of have a problem right regulate is a capacious curb
[6667.08-6671.01] and and then you've got the otherwise language as well which we sort of
[6671.01-6676.26] disgust and just on the plane language forget about the backdrop of matrix to
[6676.59-6679.86] do need major questions to when i kind of i kind of think you
[6679.86-6682.47] might know i don't think so i mean if we did we would i
[6682.48-6685.44] think we'd win for reasons express but i don't think so it also just
[6685.44-6689.97] as course sharp position is not that regulate can never mean tax or tariff
[6689.97-6693.81] okay a brief a page of teen gives you an example a president may
[6693.81-6698.31] regulate cars coming in to the city and then if it adds by charging
[6698.31-6703.02] tolls or something like that absolutely in context it does here the context you're
[6703.02-6708.45] referring to story and so on says nothing about this case that is the
[6708.45-6713.64] constitutional context about congress is used to power but it's part of how we
[6713.64-6719.19] understand language is used in and and is relevant for that purpose and then
[6719.19-6724.65] when you get licenses which are economically the same thing is to you would
[6724.65-6728.67] you agree that basically economically the same things tariffs sometimes they can be real
[6728.67-6733.83] can really got something that this economically identical to tear up authorized by the
[6733.83-6737.34] statute so where does that leave us so let me as a matter play
[6737.34-6741.42] me like the question in two parts one is about the the word regulate
[6741.45-6746.13] and the others about licensing with respect to the word regulate when it's used
[6746.13-6749.85] in the constitutional sense it's a very different than the sense in a paper
[6749.85-6753.69] that my friend is stirring when we're certainly a iba we're talking about a
[6753.69-6759.90] statue that is granting the president massive powers and so the relevant contacts that
[6759.90-6763.80] i think you look at and asking the question what did congressmen and nineteen
[6763.80-6769.11] seventy seven the best context the most natural context is what does congress say
[6769.17-6773.20] every time they grant the press i am not an hour and then did
[6773.20-6778.32] they just the one other point on this constitutions or read totally differently story
[6778.32-6782.22] in madison are talking about the constitutional for phrase and as chief justice partial
[6782.22-6786.60] southern mcculloch a constitutional expounding to prove lake city of a legal code is
[6786.60-6789.78] the opposite of the way i read the concise you follow that are you
[6790.08-6794.04] okay and what what about otherwise in i just really want to make sure
[6794.04-6798.06] i understand you say that there's a good reason was solicitor general to make
[6798.06-6800.46] that are you male be curious to see what you say about that
[6801.75-6806.10] but you know what what's your best reasoning why other the otherwise language because
[6806.10-6811.62] it's only a mechanism to implement the nine powers and the that licenses sometimes
[6811.62-6816.51] can be revenue raising and sometimes not and so of licenses can be revenue
[6816.51-6821.91] raising and you can do this otherwise to revenue raising things why wouldn't they
[6821.94-6826.98] captured so because i think again or appointee you is that that car that
[6827.07-6830.52] lies in if that there's two kinds of life to fight license come into
[6830.52-6835.86] flavors if the executive an executive order is asserting a licence fee to recoup
[6835.86-6839.25] the cost of government services or something like that is those saying to justice
[6839.25-6844.29] alito that doesn't look different than the other verbs that's not revenue raising it
[6844.29-6848.34] doesn't implicate the founders concern it doesn't advocate the concerns you wrote about in
[6848.34-6853.83] consumers research about the fear of the government of iran answer my question that
[6853.83-6858.96] must catch on hunger just plain text you're in you're moving to a major
[6858.96-6863.22] questions were not delek that's that's the movie you're making which i think
[6864.66-6868.44] find we can consider that i'm just hung on the text okay it's says
[6868.44-6873.54] by means of licenses or otherwise you've conceded that licenses are economically equivalent tariffs
[6874.02-6877.23] and the statutes is by means of licenses or
[6878.43-6883.32] otherwise regulate it's only a means and we looked at the here to means
[6883.62-6887.82] is is why isn't tariffs of permissible means on on the statue because i
[6887.82-6891.72] again it has to be related to the nine powers that a license can
[6891.72-6894.33] be we all have we have to acknowledge that and you've said a license
[6894.33-6897.42] can raise revenue and you could if said license is equivalent to a tariff
[6897.63-6900.00] economically so what
[6900.00-6904.47] that otherwise shows just as as if the if the license where the otherwise
[6904.47-6908.91] is raising revenue than it is a difference in kind from the other verbs
[6909.12-6912.66] and we looked at the history is herbs is under year and we were
[6912.66-6916.50] not able to find any involving licenses were license fees okay
[6917.73-6920.22] last question little further afield
[6921.63-6926.25] parties discuss a little bit of the analogy to the foreign commerce clause course
[6926.49-6932.01] next to it is the indian commerce clause and delegations there were very broad
[6932.04-6932.70] initially
[6933.63-6935.61] and involved licenses once again
[6936.75-6942.30] and and why why shouldn't that inform our understanding that foreign commerce clause
[6943.17-6945.57] i don't know that i have a position on that
[6946.62-6949.44] it may be as a little to a field for me to well if
[6949.44-6954.72] the president has broad authority in one part of the commerce clause why wouldn't
[6954.72-6958.86] even in the next door neighbor oh i see because cure congress is specifically
[6958.86-6963.22] been given the exclusive power over tariffs and so if they're to part with
[6963.22-6966.66] that i think is this court is said and jw hamptons that uses that
[6966.66-6970.92] harris case you'd say the same principle would apply with tariffs with the newcomers
[6970.92-6975.90] causes a tear specific are i think it's to lease intelligible principles is what
[6975.90-6979.50] this court is used for terrorists specifically and we think that's the way you
[6979.50-6983.97] should look at this and then under intelligent principles this is miles away from
[6984.00-6986.28] any delegation we have ever seen thank you
[6987.39-6991.20] this is cavanaugh a just on the next and point because you said i
[6991.20-6996.90] think that the current terrorists are on president that was a ten percent worldwide
[6997.08-7000.74] tax on every imported into the united states i believe a minute we don't
[7000.74-7004.04] need just think that's a fact you have arguments about that you made good
[7004.04-7006.41] arguments about that but just wanted that
[7007.55-7014.03] point to be be clear on on algonquin to pick up on just sort
[7014.03-7015.71] of my worst kind assist
[7018.14-7021.80] your argument here is that the statute has to use the word tariffs having
[7021.92-7022.61] basically
[7023.51-7029.09] he and we went through nixon and yoshida but then algonquin the statute for
[7029.09-7035.63] to thirty two does not use the word tears it uses adjust imports and
[7035.63-7042.14] president ford who imposed again a pretty significant terrifying oil imports and was challenge
[7042.17-7046.58] got to this court for attorneys standing were you are stood up and said
[7046.58-7050.27] the licence fee now before the court involves the brought us exercise of the
[7050.27-7054.02] tariff power in the history of the american republic in fact we would have
[7054.02-7058.55] to go back to george the third stamp tax to determine as broadened executive
[7058.55-7063.20] powers claimed in this case the statue is a simple one it does not
[7063.20-7068.75] mention the tariff on it's face the argument there was the word terror of
[7068.81-7075.05] was not mentioned used to just imports the court obviously nine know projects that
[7075.05-7080.06] argument in part because as others have pointed out the court quarters a lot
[7080.06-7085.01] of question what's the difference when a quota and a tariff and was diverse
[7085.01-7087.38] really embargo and a tariff and so
[7088.34-7092.27] when when the court rights the a piece and it says we find no
[7092.27-7098.03] support in the language of the statute the language for response contention that the
[7098.03-7102.11] authorization to the present to adjust to import should be written to encompass only
[7102.11-7107.57] quantitative methods are you quarters as opposed to monetary methods are you license fees
[7107.57-7113.63] of affecting such adjustments so on your basic point that you need the word
[7113.63-7118.82] terror algonquin says you don't need the word terror of and that was president
[7118.85-7124.31] ford's oil imports it's and i know the oral argument goes through this
[7125.21-7128.69] your answer there's a lot they're just as cabin are so please bear with
[7128.69-7132.44] me first said like a will clear good pooper clarify what our position is
[7132.44-7136.34] generally and then deal with algonquin our position is not that you have to
[7136.34-7140.39] use the word terror for any other magic word it's true that congress has
[7140.39-7146.05] used a specialized vocabulary since the founding since seventeen ninety using words like tariffs
[7146.06-7148.97] or duties but as i was saying earlier to just as course that you
[7148.97-7152.27] could even use the word regulate as or patriot teen of our brief says
[7152.33-7157.43] you can even imagine something that's as quote the president may regulate importation by
[7157.43-7161.66] requiring importers to pay ten percent of the value of goods to the treasury
[7161.66-7165.02] so i don't think you have to use any particular worried the question is
[7165.02-7169.32] in context is it does algonquin didn't have anything like that but keep going
[7169.32-7174.38] to work on could does have i think our contacts that miles apart from
[7174.62-7177.89] what the what the government is seeking here to do with the iba so
[7177.89-7181.97] first of all it is a common sense statute i understand there's some rhetoric
[7181.97-7185.39] by as ring and such a know some rhetoric by the lawyer who stood
[7185.39-7188.39] here before which is of course forgivable
[7189.35-7194.51] item it was a statute about one product to thirty two his article by
[7194.51-7199.70] article it's one product this is a billion products or even more that the
[7199.70-7199.91] gov
[7200.00-7204.71] the seeking to count quinn was expressly a trade statues the nineteen sixty two
[7204.71-7209.69] trade act it's everything this case isn't are gone queen had a specific reference
[7209.69-7214.91] to the word duties and a separate provision algonquin had a legislative history that
[7214.91-7219.50] was clear as day that the president was it with the president was given
[7219.50-7223.43] this power and understand this court today doesn't look to the legislative history but
[7223.43-7228.38] the way algonquin got to where it was was by saying the legislative history
[7228.38-7231.89] the chief sponsor of the yeah i think i'll disagree with you on that
[7231.92-7235.40] it does a plain text and then says is there anything the legislative history
[7235.40-7238.73] to defeat the plane tax i disagree pretty strongly with you on that but
[7238.73-7242.75] it doesn't defeat your point keep going okay so i'd also say in the
[7242.75-7246.99] maybe the most important point two thirty two or point argument is not just
[7247.01-7250.55] that you have to specifically authorized to tear up with those some part of
[7250.55-7257.09] word but also that one way of understanding whether congress is delegating it's awesome
[7257.45-7261.17] care of power it's awesome tax in paris ask are there are limits to
[7261.17-7265.16] what congress has put in and in algonquin in section two thirty two the
[7265.16-7269.84] court points to in goes painstakingly through all the limits of the first words
[7269.84-7273.83] of the decision or all about how constrain the statute is it's a were
[7273.83-7278.96] tech elated scheme the cabinet secretaries have to make certain findings there are specific
[7278.96-7285.68] statutory factors congress as the president must look out before acting the public hearings
[7285.89-7290.12] there are limited remedies quote to the extent necessary all of that isn't the
[7290.12-7294.56] statue all of that isn't the algonquin opinion none of it is an ipa
[7294.83-7299.53] that's the problem and that's why just like days and more the algonquin case
[7299.53-7304.16] said this is a very limited decision limited just the facts thank you for
[7305.21-7309.95] a spirit so this license thing as important to me and do you agree
[7310.13-7312.17] that pursuance of paper
[7313.19-7318.74] the president could impose could regulate commerce by imposing a licence fee
[7319.64-7324.19] and sorry who's of that weekend could the president regulate commerce and to rape
[7324.74-7328.70] by using a licensing fee not a fee so i should have said this
[7328.70-7334.82] earlier but license is different from a licensing fee or april and twitter authorize
[7334.85-7341.57] licenses not license fees and no president has ever charge to my knowledge fees
[7341.57-7348.14] under the us to statutes for the licenses sophie's impermissible licenses of is permissible
[7348.14-7353.15] if they cover the costs of the scheme might be mighty i mean but
[7353.15-7357.68] but once they start revenue raising you implicate the most serious concern and i
[7357.68-7361.46] thought you can to justice course it's there was no difference between a tariff
[7361.58-7366.53] and a licensing fee nationally if if the licensing fee is just to wreak
[7366.53-7370.13] i didn't concede that and so right and if the licensing fees just to
[7370.13-7374.36] recoup the costs are government services i think that maybe okay and only you
[7374.36-7378.11] need to get into it here the government is asserting a power which they
[7378.26-7383.90] say in their bruce to you raises four trillion dollars so you will understand
[7384.32-7389.78] the statute to permit licensing and the sense of permission like we will not
[7389.78-7393.38] allow you to trade with us we will not allow your goods to be
[7393.38-7398.15] imported unless we license it absolutely and just spirit i think like just the
[7398.15-7402.80] natural reading if you're to look at the word licenses and think wow congress
[7402.80-7408.44] smuggled this incredible power to do all of these different things that the government
[7408.44-7411.98] is doing here thirty nine percent taxes on some countries and others
[7412.85-7415.76] through the word license that new license exportation
[7417.17-7420.89] i don't think so for the reason that you know right now actually looked
[7420.89-7424.46] into it this a man i think you maybe not licensing fees exactly what
[7424.46-7427.97] could you license exportation like saying we're not going to allow certain products that
[7427.97-7432.53] have national security implications to be export it just so licensing could be used
[7432.59-7435.62] in that sense or out as a revenue as you as you okay so
[7435.62-7440.48] you went back and forth with justice course coursage about the implications of the
[7440.48-7445.25] president's authority over foreign affairs and whether the major questions actor and applies you
[7445.25-7446.42] say than and i eat than
[7447.44-7451.46] the president work presents war powers are not implicated in that was part of
[7451.46-7455.45] the reason why you say that we should think of this differently than some
[7455.45-7461.09] other historical examples where the commander in chief power war powers were implicated but
[7461.09-7465.53] the same language appears in the trading with the enemies acts in which war
[7465.53-7469.16] powers would be implicated so do you think the language should be and of
[7469.16-7472.55] course that is what president nixon relied on so do you think that the
[7472.55-7477.68] language would be interpreted differently and that context even though the commander in chief
[7477.68-7480.77] power in the war power would be implicated one hundred percent i think of
[7480.77-7485.18] be interpreted differently just as jack same regulate commerce language yes because it once
[7485.18-7489.98] your time i want you to be carrying over wartime precedents to peace time
[7489.98-7493.73] for me i don't understand that then because everybody agrees the language came and
[7493.73-7497.48] ipa came from the training with enemy i say you're saying and as one
[7497.48-7499.97] meaning and the training with the enemy act and a different meaning
[7500.00-7504.50] ii bad that same regulate commerce know i think of the conquer territory language
[7504.50-7508.70] and all that may go to the president article to powers has inherited powers
[7508.94-7512.60] in concord territory but i don't think it gets the government where they need
[7512.60-7516.32] to go to see a see brief and the brief by professor paul stephen
[7516.50-7522.47] goes through and explains why and nineteen thirty three when congress decided to bring
[7522.47-7527.36] these concepts into peace time it's severed the war time roots and there's an
[7527.38-7532.43] extensive legislative history henderson that but i thought that was about act that maybe
[7532.43-7536.42] and maybe i'm just a tracking i mean i think there's been some discussion
[7536.42-7542.48] of whether the president would have inherent article to authority and time to impose
[7542.54-7547.19] tariffs to dissent is that what you're talking about are you actually talking about
[7547.22-7552.11] statute that said regularly importation in war time when you think it could have
[7552.89-7557.45] the tariff power confer through that language in a war making statute but not
[7557.45-7560.24] in i know i don't think can first that didn't either place i think
[7560.24-7565.34] the president in the it's located the president's power in conquered territories not in
[7565.34-7569.00] the trading with a news addict or anything like that of router and constituted
[7569.00-7573.38] start our coming from the law for okay and then if if you when
[7574.01-7576.89] tell me how the reimbursement process would work would it be a complete mess
[7576.93-7581.99] mean you're saying before the government promised reimbursement and and now you're saying oh
[7581.99-7585.62] that's rich but how would this work it seems to me like it could
[7585.62-7588.44] be a mess so the first thing i'd say is that just underscores just
[7588.44-7591.74] so major question this is the very fact that you were dealing with us
[7591.74-7596.00] with quotas there's no refund process of to the tune of billions of dollars
[7596.00-7600.47] or embargoes but there is here but for our case the way with workers
[7600.53-7604.31] in this case the government's split stipulated for the five plaintiffs that they would
[7604.31-7607.91] get the refunds so for us that's how it would work your question i
[7607.91-7610.88] take it as about everyone else we don't have a class action and or
[7610.88-7615.80] anything like that with respect to everyone else there's a whole specialize body of
[7615.80-7621.65] trade law and it to nineteen u s fifteen fourteen outlines all these administrative
[7621.65-7626.78] procedures it's a very complicated thing there's gotta be an administrative protest there was
[7626.96-7631.10] a harbor management case earlier that this court was involved with and united states
[7631.10-7634.94] shoo in which you know the reef on process took a long time the
[7634.94-7640.10] or any number of claims and equitable really sell a mess so it's difficult
[7640.10-7644.09] absolutely we don't we don't deny that it's difficult but i think what this
[7644.09-7646.07] court has said i'm in pain
[7646.91-7651.50] in the mckesson case and nineteen nineties that serious economic dislocation isn't into reason
[7651.50-7656.36] do something northern pipeline you guys stage decision for a while in order to
[7656.57-7661.40] let the congressional process unfold there may be a congressional process here as well
[7662.06-7665.75] you know your you may be able to also be that this court could
[7665.75-7670.31] limited decision to prospect of relief under the john q hammonds cases lots of
[7670.31-7676.82] possibilities just distraction so i think i read algonquin differently injustice cavanaugh
[7678.59-7683.72] when i look at it's analysis it absolutely does a textual review but then
[7683.72-7689.30] it says quote turning from section two thirty choose language to it's legislative history
[7689.63-7693.95] again there is much to suggest that the president's authority extends the imposition of
[7693.95-7696.53] monetary exactions and
[7697.85-7704.72] i appreciate that perhaps that factor is no longer in vogue but did you
[7704.72-7709.70] look into the legislative history here to determine whether there is anything that supports
[7709.70-7715.28] the conclusion that congress actually intended for this i eat a statute to allow
[7715.31-7720.56] are authorized the president to impose these tariffs i did i if i blinked
[7720.56-7724.88] i would miss it because it was virtually nothing and in fact both page
[7724.88-7729.11] pays to about the house and senate report outline all of the powers that
[7729.11-7734.21] are given under ipa and into and none of none of them have tariff
[7734.23-7740.45] there's one brief mention of tariff in the legislative history but nothing else and
[7740.45-7744.02] by the way i pass by voice vote it was pay you know there
[7744.02-7747.98] was not controversial we don't deny it as a big major statute but the
[7747.98-7753.62] question is did authorize tariffs one of the most contested things since or founding
[7753.77-7756.29] and you know they they're out of thing in the legislative has deals just
[7756.29-7761.00] it now to the extent that congress did not authorize the president to do
[7761.00-7765.74] something that those verbs are there that the congress was giving the president some
[7765.74-7766.43] authority
[7767.45-7771.68] do you see have been connecting those birds what was congress trying to do
[7771.68-7775.16] and want me to say that i see in the senate report which i
[7775.16-7779.42] mentioned earlier that congress says that it was trying to give the president the
[7779.42-7786.41] authority to quote control or freeze property transactions were foreign interest is involved and
[7786.41-7790.10] that seems to dovetail with the verbs that are being used in the statue
[7790.11-7793.46] good what what's your view of what congress was trying to do with this
[7793.46-7798.68] legislation that's exactly right the responding to all sorts of probe do a foreign
[7798.68-7799.97] policy emergencies and
[7800.13-7805.07] foreign threats and they're giving the president economic sanctions power so what does the
[7805.07-7811.43] word regulate importation do it under under that framework if we understand that congress
[7811.43-7815.39] was trying to give this kind of embargo authority in the time of an
[7815.39-7820.91] emergency when it says regulate importation what what was it envisioning it was envisioning
[7820.94-7824.90] all the things that the president since nineteen seventy seven going back to justice
[7824.90-7829.94] cavernous question have used it for so they've used it for quotas like limitations
[7829.94-7834.11] on the number of goods they've used it for screening and reporting requirements like
[7834.11-7838.94] executive order twelve to eighty four about reporting property of the show and they've
[7838.94-7845.12] used it for standards like domestic safety standards environmental standards labour requirements they've used
[7845.12-7849.65] it for bargains so all of those are things that i think congress had
[7849.65-7853.40] in mind and ipa and i think the proof of this that it's not
[7853.40-7858.29] this massive statute that allows the government to do anything is deems and more
[7858.29-7865.70] itself because this court rejected the idea that regulate includes the claims extinguishment that
[7865.70-7870.17] was that issue in that case that a much more limited statute and just
[7870.17-7875.36] as jackson it was a predecessor just as jackson who said who said you
[7875.36-7879.77] know that quote for all it's defects delays and inconveniences men have discovered know
[7879.77-7884.75] technique for long preserving free government except that the executive be under the law
[7885.05-7890.63] and the lobby made by parliamentary deliberations such institutions maybe just destined to pass
[7890.63-7894.71] away but it is a duty of this court to be last not first
[7894.83-7897.98] to give it up and i take it my friends argument on the other
[7897.98-7903.41] side is in deep tension with youngstown and that canonical principal thank you
[7904.25-7904.97] thank you council
[7913.16-7913.67] forgotten
[7914.63-7918.35] mister chief justice in a please the court i'd like to begin by picking
[7918.35-7922.76] up with the exchanges with just disparate and just a score such about licenses
[7922.76-7924.02] and license fees
[7925.04-7927.53] because i think we ended on the right note but i just wanted to
[7927.53-7931.34] make sure that our that at least my clients position is clear on this
[7931.58-7937.13] licenses are different from license fees and i am not aware of any history
[7937.13-7942.14] in the five decades that are uber has been in force of any fees
[7942.14-7947.66] charged for the licenses under this statute this is a statue that the licenses
[7947.66-7952.61] can be used for example the president might ban certain transactions with a foreign
[7952.61-7957.80] country but then grant licenses to do them for humanitarian reasons but as far
[7957.80-7961.55] as i'm aware there's never been a few charged for that and i do
[7961.55-7965.15] walk in the courts questions but i think that's i just want to make
[7965.21-7970.49] absolute the question is what is or otherwise do well or or otherwise could
[7970.49-7976.79] be of things like instructions or licenses but if can it's it's fundamentally having
[7976.79-7980.18] something that is a revenue raising measure or even that is just and exaction
[7980.18-7985.70] of some sort is a fun is fundamentally categorically different from what we understand
[7985.70-7988.49] instructions and licenses to be involved just like
[7989.69-7994.28] we think regulate doesn't carry the financial connotation given the other verbs there
[7996.11-7999.14] if if i could turn to some of the nineteenth century history that we
[7999.14-8001.12] were discussing as well because i think
[8002.23-8004.06] there may be a little bit more to add their
[8005.65-8011.20] the the the nineteenth century cases about the president's inherent article to authority to
[8011.44-8017.53] with respect to in a wartime with respect to importation is is not the
[8017.53-8023.62] power to impose tariffs on imports coming into the united states that is not
[8023.62-8027.64] what any of those cases were about they were about the president's power
[8028.45-8033.88] you know at in a wartime as an occupying military force to impose tariffs
[8033.94-8038.32] in occupied territory that in mexico in the philippines and california
[8039.55-8043.36] the civil war case might be the closest case but even there what we
[8043.36-8047.59] were talking about where we're essentially there were like there were licensing fees but
[8047.59-8053.56] they were export fees they were fees that were being imposed on the exportation
[8053.56-8057.52] of cotton from the occupied south
[8058.72-8062.83] into the north and so i don't think any of that provides authority for
[8062.83-8067.12] this general notion that there is a background principle that the president even in
[8067.12-8072.07] wartime has an article to authority to impose tariffs certainly without the consent of
[8072.07-8072.70] congress
[8075.07-8080.32] you agree i assume given all the votes on this list that the president
[8080.38-8085.81] could do something like just shut down all trade between us and say you
[8085.81-8087.49] know china right
[8088.39-8091.99] be guess i mean there are other limitations okay so doesn't it seem and
[8091.99-8095.35] and i think this is one of that that points that algonquin makes and
[8095.35-8098.32] i think it's a point the just as cabin i was making doesn't it
[8098.32-8099.90] seem then i mean i don't want to use
[8100.10-8104.32] phrase lesser power lesser included measure but doesn't it seem like it would make
[8104.32-8108.58] sense than that congress would want the president to use something that was less
[8108.88-8113.32] weaker medicine than completely shutting down trade as leverage to try to get a
[8113.32-8116.80] foreign nation to do something and the president can in the form of for
[8116.80-8122.71] example quotas but what makes an embargo or quotas fundamentally different from terrorists
[8123.55-8128.29] as much as my friend is already explained his the revenue raising aspect of
[8128.29-8133.93] that that makes it a far more significant power it creates additional danger of
[8133.96-8137.95] of over use and i think the other point as just distraction was pointing
[8137.95-8143.50] out is that it it's seeds control over whether the transaction occurs from the
[8143.50-8148.09] government to the individuals engaging in this transaction and and that is not what
[8148.12-8153.91] are you is and ten what makes something revenue raising mean fees raise money
[8153.97-8156.91] and unless they're going to be kind of wonder one this is exactly what
[8156.91-8160.60] it costs mean it it might raise some surplus it might make them at
[8160.60-8164.98] rest some extra so is it the purpose if the purpose of the fee
[8165.01-8168.76] or the terrorists is to raise money i don't have a purpose that makes
[8168.76-8172.09] it revenue raising or is it just the fact of surplus created that goes
[8172.09-8175.30] to the treasury how do we decide the yes i think it's the effect
[8175.30-8178.06] and to be clear i i think there's a there's there would be a
[8178.06-8184.90] serious difficulty with interpreting any of these words even to allow revenue neutral exactions
[8184.90-8187.84] here because none of them involve none of that and began as far as
[8187.84-8190.81] i'm aware i uber has never been used in that way but i don't
[8190.81-8195.46] that even a processing fee i am not aware of any use of that
[8195.46-8196.00] sort of
[8196.84-8200.62] an under our uber but but even if even if that is permissible it
[8200.71-8204.49] i think that's permissible precisely because it isn't it doesn't have the effect of
[8204.49-8210.07] raising resident mr catch your preferred to common sense of several times and i
[8210.07-8214.24] want to pick up on just as parents question because your interpretation the statute
[8214.39-8220.48] she pointed out would allow the president to shut down all trade with every
[8220.48-8228.28] other country in the world or to impose some significant quota on imports from
[8228.37-8235.00] every other country in the world but would not allow a one percent tariff
[8235.87-8242.14] and that leaves in the government's words and river and odd donut hole in
[8242.14-8247.03] the statue why would a rational congress say yeah we're going to give the
[8247.03-8251.86] president parents shut down trade i mean think about the effects but you're admitting
[8252.01-8257.89] that powers in their yard but can't do a one percent tariff
[8258.70-8259.18] that
[8260.08-8263.17] doesn't seem but i want to get your answer
[8264.16-8267.73] the have a lot of common sense behind it i think it absolutely does
[8267.73-8271.06] because it's a fundamentally different power it's it's not a donut hole it's a
[8271.06-8275.80] it's a different kind of pastry and on that on not power as a
[8275.83-8276.22] good one
[8277.42-8282.40] on that power though in you've said this many times mr casual tonight and
[8282.49-8289.03] look i get there's obviously but the court has repeatedly said a tariff on
[8289.03-8296.20] foreign imports is an exercise of the commerce power not of the taxation power
[8296.32-8301.00] and i'm repeating some but john marshall said the joseph story and chief justice
[8301.00-8303.13] use in the nineteen thirty three case and
[8304.00-8308.23] we've said that quite a bit of time which seems to least undermined a
[8308.23-8312.73] bit your point that it's an entirely different power because if it is foreign
[8312.73-8316.60] commerce power it's the same power the just as bear with sorry amount of
[8316.72-8320.44] just and bar going trade with the entire world which you admit his in
[8320.44-8324.55] this statue look at their couple of points in there and i'll try to
[8324.55-8325.54] get to all of them but
[8326.47-8329.32] i mean i think all of us agree that context is what matters here
[8329.71-8334.39] and that you certainly could use the word regulate to do to talk about
[8334.57-8337.69] a terrifying power like you could use it to talk about of taxing power
[8338.50-8341.47] in we impose taxes for regulatory purposes as well
[8342.28-8348.55] but the the federal government hasn't identified a single other federal statute that uses
[8348.58-8353.80] the term regulate to authorize tariffs or taxes that is just a different kind
[8353.83-8357.70] of power and i thought your point in response to justice have an aunt
[8357.76-8362.68] it's a different kind of power because the power that's been authorized by this
[8362.68-8368.74] statute is the power to control or freeze trade that's exact that's what congress
[8368.74-8373.18] was getting at and so if that's true and we have to read regulate
[8373.24-8377.56] in that context that's exactly right and i think the reason it getting back
[8377.56-8378.97] to common sense as to why
[8379.93-8384.76] legislature might authorize that is that you might not fear abusive that power in
[8384.76-8388.69] the same way that you would be concerned about abuse of power to impose
[8389.20-8393.94] unlimited taxes with know with with sort of know controlling was will largest that
[8394.03-8398.64] because i mean there is a sort of commonsensical intuition that one is in
[8398.64-8400.00] in just as cavernous exam
[8400.00-8404.62] the that one is greater in one is lesser so what what why why
[8404.62-8408.31] is that not right because to be blunt about it there's nothing that one
[8408.31-8410.59] of them there's something in it for the government and one of them there
[8410.59-8411.04] isn't
[8412.15-8418.03] actions that bring in revenue from from the pockets or taxpayers to the treasury
[8418.06-8422.89] pose a different set of concerns are framers were very concerned about that a
[8422.89-8427.81] different set of concerns how why it because they bring in revenue and because
[8427.81-8431.62] of that that creates and that seems a little torn a logical that why
[8431.65-8436.36] is it that the revenue raisers are in a different category because if look
[8436.39-8440.92] if if there if there is some sort of international emergency and the though
[8440.95-8444.19] with the appropriate way to deal with it is to make sure that no
[8444.19-8447.07] more than a thousand of this product comes into this country
[8448.12-8452.77] at at a particular time the this statute gives the president the power to
[8452.77-8456.39] ensure that exactly no more than one thousand come in at this time setting
[8456.55-8460.42] setting a tariff doesn't ensure that only one thousand and will come into this
[8460.42-8465.04] country it it's seeds control over whether the transaction occurs and what it does
[8465.04-8466.36] is it is it then
[8467.74-8473.68] you know ads revenue to the treasury and that is that is against something
[8473.68-8478.60] that are framers thought was extremely important and and a court article one by
[8478.60-8481.72] algonquin and mean this kind of goes back to just as kevin as point
[8481.75-8486.97] of conklin rejects the idea that it was impermissible to use the fees and
[8486.97-8491.05] we can call them in a license fees that functioned as terrorists or duties
[8491.08-8496.30] in that case whatever that algonquin said that congress could use them exaction of
[8496.30-8500.68] money to control quantity and it i hear what you're saying is like we
[8500.68-8504.61] can control quantity by numbers by imposing hard limits but not by money but
[8504.61-8509.21] that's not what algonquin said so i guess oh no why why well i
[8509.23-8512.98] that and i and i don't mean to suggest that you can't use exactions
[8512.98-8518.86] to control quantity what i think algonquin just shows the importance of context it
[8518.86-8523.99] might be perfectly natural to read or phrase like adjust imports in the context
[8523.99-8527.02] of a statute the talks about terrorists in the context of the trade of
[8527.02-8531.16] the trade expansion act that has all sorts of provisions about tariffs and about
[8531.16-8535.78] the president adjusting tariff rates it might be perfectly natural in that context to
[8535.78-8540.31] read a phrase like adjust the imports to be referring to changing tariff rates
[8540.52-8546.10] it's just as unnatural to read a phrase like regulate importation the to discuss
[8546.10-8550.51] that when statute has nothing to do with tariffs and doesn't otherwise mentioned house
[8550.51-8553.96] at all and are going imposing tariffs is a bit i'm inside you think
[8553.96-8557.62] that just blocking all trade is a bigger deal than imposing a one percent
[8557.62-8560.59] tariff across the board i think it would be a huge deal it is
[8560.59-8564.91] just a different kind of deal imo going to was not a constitutional case
[8564.91-8568.63] regret it was a statutory interpretation case for and so the question there was
[8568.63-8574.36] simply was congress actually trying to give we did congress in that statute give
[8574.36-8580.18] the president the authority to impose these kinds of exactions and the court looked
[8580.18-8583.30] at the text and it looked at the alleged it lit legislative history and
[8583.30-8587.80] which there was a number of clues that congress had actually intended to do
[8587.80-8591.70] that yes yes and it looks not just at the text of those specific
[8591.70-8595.66] words the but but also the context of what else was in the statute
[8595.66-8598.87] in the fact that there's some of the factors that the president was supposed
[8598.87-8603.37] to be considering keep going and it would make perfect sense i think in
[8603.37-8607.36] a time of emergency for the many of the reasons the general sour pointed
[8607.39-8611.98] out that congress would want the president to have the kind of authority that
[8612.01-8617.56] is imposed when you are embargo wing things when you are stopping the trade
[8617.56-8622.45] when you are saying you know for emergency reasons we're not letting any of
[8622.48-8626.02] this product come in i mean sure that's a big deal but the nature
[8626.02-8629.89] of it makes sense in terms of an emergency i think what you're saying
[8629.92-8633.91] is that the idea that the government would use it's authority to be raising
[8633.91-8640.09] revenues in this situation is a different kind of power exactly this is about
[8640.09-8645.19] is this a statute about giving the president control over assets over transactions over
[8645.19-8648.52] access to bank and tariffs don't do that you said that only about exactly
[8648.52-8652.96] not tariffs and taxied control exactly what those sorts of things so they sort
[8652.96-8656.83] of undermine the goals and the purposes of this kind of statute is that
[8656.83-8660.40] right guess that's exactly right room can i hear what you said grab from
[8660.40-8661.54] what you said it seems
[8662.59-8668.50] and you said this that the reason for drawing a distinction between tariffs and
[8668.83-8669.85] an embargo
[8670.69-8676.00] is the suspicion that tariffs will be used to raise money and therefore to
[8676.00-8682.03] circumvent congress' power to control taxes so it's a question of
[8683.05-8687.16] the risk that's involved in my right yeah that's what it boils down to
[8687.46-8690.79] yes well in it's a question of understanding what congress would have thought it
[8690.81-8695.65] what what what powers congress would have thought it was conferring would congress have
[8695.65-8699.94] understood the phrase regulator i mean the question is why would call
[8700.00-8703.72] the say you can impose a quota you can impose a ban but you
[8703.72-8708.94] can't impose a tariff and your answer i gather is because when tariff is
[8708.94-8714.19] imposed where's were suspect that what's going on we were suspicious about was going
[8714.19-8717.76] on we think that what the government is trying what the executive is trying
[8717.76-8722.11] to do is to is to raise revenue and that's our that's our business
[8722.32-8725.23] right would it has to be yes and
[8726.10-8729.76] every we we know that every other time that congress has authorized well that's
[8729.76-8732.79] it you know you're getting into a different argument then would you say the
[8732.79-8739.96] same thing if the measure is really about an emergency and undisputed emergency and
[8739.96-8746.19] a really dire emergency yeah air would you have the same suspicion you a
[8746.59-8752.05] the the yes absolutely and again i'll i'll refer back to adjust distractions concurrence
[8752.05-8755.23] in youngstown that emergency powers tend to breed emergencies
[8756.04-8759.64] a look at the biden versus nebraska i think is you know says very
[8759.64-8762.79] clear and i really don't think you're answering the question the question is would
[8762.79-8765.49] you have the same suspicion when it is perfectly
[8766.33-8771.73] apparent from context that what the president is trying to do is to achieve
[8771.97-8775.48] a goal other than the raising of money
[8777.22-8780.85] i think what i'm trying to say is that you you have to read
[8780.85-8784.12] the statute the way that congress would have understood it when it was enacted
[8784.27-8787.66] not how it is used in any particular case may be used for very
[8787.66-8792.01] good reasons and in particular case but the question is would congress have understood
[8792.01-8796.48] itself to be seeding this power with no limits on like every other terrifying
[8796.48-8799.85] statute with our own i know i know that point let me ask you
[8799.85-8801.55] when an unrelated question
[8802.51-8808.09] mister cat you know listed some of the things that presidents have done under
[8808.33-8808.96] a book
[8809.80-8811.99] such as screening
[8812.86-8813.58] screening
[8814.39-8815.14] imports
[8820.93-8824.05] do any of the other verbs i iba
[8825.01-8830.14] talk about screen who could could screening of imports be done under any of
[8830.14-8831.88] the other verbs you know you but
[8832.81-8837.00] i think maybe but it would have been with a one prevent and end
[8837.10-8840.88] so i think the question would be cleaning is preventing well it i think
[8840.88-8844.72] it depends what you're screening for but if you were it okay how about
[8844.72-8845.41] imposing
[8846.64-8852.43] domestic see requirements that promote that are needed to safeguard domestic safety
[8853.66-8859.24] any any read any other provision besides regulate any other verb besides regulate that
[8859.24-8861.52] we will again i think if we're talking about
[8862.54-8867.79] potentially blocking some property from coming into this country because of safety concern it
[8867.79-8870.94] might be that prevent would have gotten new their what i think regulate does
[8870.94-8875.05] is it is it clarifies and amplifies that that you don't just you know
[8875.05-8877.93] it it can be nuanced and that way i can say we will let
[8877.93-8881.08] this kind of this come in if it has certain safety requirements if certain
[8881.08-8885.25] features have been disabled something like that and i think so i think regulate
[8885.25-8888.91] harmonizes with prevent investigate during the tendency
[8889.87-8895.45] of block during the of even investigation those sorts of the context point the
[8895.45-8900.58] context of the statue what congress would have understood it's an emergency statue
[8901.84-8907.78] and presumably congress wants to give the president tools to respond to the emergency
[8907.80-8908.98] an appropriate way
[8909.82-8913.72] and it seems odd to imagine and
[8914.71-8918.58] meeting in the oval office where the president's told well we have a problem
[8918.58-8925.81] with i won't name a country but contrary acts and you can stop all
[8925.81-8931.63] trade with that country and i'm not sure that's a you know wise policy
[8931.63-8936.04] to give that much produce their right you agree it's in this statute but
[8936.94-8940.60] in the presence has words to extreme i want to calibrate my response to
[8940.60-8944.83] deal with this and maybe it you know a tariff of some kind of
[8945.13-8950.23] like we can't do that so you're forcing the president to respond to an
[8950.23-8955.51] emergency and you know just as leaders reduce the point about you know are
[8955.51-8958.48] real emergency you're taking away
[8959.38-8963.37] the president suite of tools when the one is much more extreme that is
[8963.37-8965.77] authorized that just seems a bit unusual
[8967.51-8973.03] you know think about india right now the terrified india right that's designed to
[8973.03-8978.49] help settle the russia ukraine war as i understand it is really i don't
[8978.49-8983.59] pretend to be an expert but if that's gone you know that's a tool
[8983.68-8989.08] that's designed target for facing the most serious crisis in the world and that's
[8989.86-8995.50] that's help out the window so i just thinks she's contextually emergency it's just
[8995.50-8999.70] a bit unusual to read it that way by i take your response taxation
[8999.70-8999.94] stuff
[9000.00-9002.94] then you gotta stick with that line fight know and i don't think it's
[9002.94-9005.97] just that because i mean i i do think it's that but it but
[9005.97-9010.92] it's also that there are a range of tools that are more calibrated that
[9010.92-9013.77] the president can do it doesn't have to be a complete embargo it can
[9013.78-9018.72] be limits on particular kinds of products it could be quantity and another in
[9018.72-9025.20] the history of trade trade efforts to respond and pushback you taken one away
[9025.29-9028.59] well end the president and there are many other statutes that might apply depending
[9028.59-9032.46] on your exact circumstances several one three one two three council and is a
[9032.46-9038.40] good point we're forgetting here is a very fundamental point which is the constitution
[9038.40-9039.18] is structured
[9040.02-9043.86] so that if i'm going to be asked to pay for something as a
[9043.86-9050.13] citizen that it's through a bill that is generated through congress and president has
[9050.13-9054.09] the power to veto it or not but i'm not going to be taxed
[9054.15-9056.13] unless both houses
[9056.94-9061.74] the executive in the legislature have made that choice correct that's exactly right to
[9061.80-9068.22] and so there is something it's not just taxing power quite taxing power the
[9068.22-9074.67] question is do we permit the president she used the taxing power to affect
[9075.15-9076.83] his personal choices
[9077.94-9082.44] of what is good policy for me to pay for that's exactly right the
[9082.44-9089.19] question is it has decides who decides and under what circumstances now with respect
[9089.22-9089.97] to this
[9090.82-9094.50] i'm not even going to the pretext argument okay
[9095.31-9100.56] but the president threaten to impose a ten percent tax on canada for an
[9100.56-9106.26] addict man on tariffs during the world series he imposed a forty percent tax
[9106.26-9107.07] on brazil
[9108.03-9114.30] because it's supreme court permitted the person prosecution of one of it's former presidents
[9114.30-9115.44] for criminal activity
[9117.15-9119.88] the point is those may be good policies
[9120.96-9125.97] but does statue that gives without limit
[9127.08-9131.22] the power to a president to impose this kind of tax
[9132.03-9134.13] does it require more than the word regularly
[9134.94-9136.56] exact that's your point yes
[9137.73-9138.60] thank you council
[9139.95-9144.87] did mr carter you'll say anything this morning which you disagree know i think
[9144.87-9149.01] we cleared up and any maybe potential disagreement about licensing fees but i think
[9149.01-9150.00] we all agree on that
[9151.14-9151.80] the system's
[9152.97-9154.35] this further
[9155.37-9155.97] risky
[9156.99-9157.62] discourses
[9158.97-9161.47] so i just want a follow up on just to sort of myers question
[9161.47-9164.16] questionable the end of a law morning afternoon
[9165.93-9170.07] it does seem to me tell me if i'm wrong that of really key
[9170.07-9175.02] part of the context here if not the dispositive one for you is the
[9175.02-9181.20] constitutional assignment of the taxing power to congress the power to reach into the
[9181.53-9186.48] pockets of the american people is just different and it's been different since the
[9186.48-9188.67] founding in the navigation acts
[9189.62-9194.82] part of the spark the american revolution were parliament sort of the power to
[9194.82-9199.83] tax to regulate commerce some of those were revenue raising some of them didn't
[9199.86-9202.44] raise a lot of revenue and had a lot of
[9203.88-9206.16] pirates in america at the time
[9207.58-9212.19] and americans thought he even parliament couldn't do that but that had to be
[9212.19-9218.97] done locally through our elected representatives isn't that really the major questions on delegation
[9219.00-9223.05] or whatever you want to describe it isn't that which really animating your argument
[9223.05-9226.23] today i think it's a huge piece of what's animating our argument thank you
[9228.54-9229.11] the scam
[9231.51-9237.60] jackson i just invite you briefly to address your kind of second tier arguments
[9237.99-9242.58] i'm assuming that the president can impose these codes of taxi or and tariffs
[9243.51-9248.64] why do you think for example that the trafficking and tear up here does
[9248.64-9254.76] not deal with the drug trafficking emergency for the purpose of this analysis so
[9254.76-9258.93] it doesn't deal with it because it's not a sanctions imposed against traffickers
[9259.77-9262.80] it is a say it it is if if you think of it as
[9262.80-9267.63] a sanction it is a sanction imposed against people importing lawful goods in the
[9267.66-9270.72] doesn't that indirect the of that that happens all the time right i mean
[9270.75-9273.09] all the other authorities and directly
[9273.90-9277.98] provide leverage on countries in this way i don't think so i think that
[9277.98-9282.27] they are that the history of of a you by an even it of
[9282.27-9288.66] tweet is imposing sanctions directly on the wrongdoers these are statutes about providing sanction
[9288.66-9290.55] authority against against
[9291.39-9295.56] international actors whose behavior we want to change and that's not what terrorists aren't
[9295.71-9296.22] thank you
[9297.12-9299.97] thank you council rebuttal general sally
[9301.26-9305.64] thank you mister chief justice just three points one an interpretive point the and
[9305.64-9311.07] language here is regular importation and again by means of instruments licenses or otherwise
[9311.70-9316.02] their argument is that that phrase carries with it a whole host of on
[9316.02-9320.79] enumerated forms of regulation including coders licenses license a pair of that come with
[9320.79-9323.22] fees as long as they're not as long as they're sort of profit new
[9323.22-9329.25] trophies environmental restrictions qualitative restrictions reports and so forth it just a one form
[9329.25-9334.44] of regulation they would not include is tariff regulation which supports is the quintessential
[9334.59-9339.21] most historically tested method of regulating imports and so that it that that that
[9339.21-9344.49] additional phrase about you know by means of insurance license or otherwise really sort
[9344.49-9349.65] of reinforces the plane meaning the ordinary natural meeting a regular importation here so
[9349.65-9354.03] when it comes just plain text the statue their argument is a donut type
[9354.06-9357.69] argument and it's not an argument that does justice to the statutes plain text
[9357.99-9361.35] on the none none delegation point just as course that you alluded to the
[9361.56-9364.62] front of your delegations of the indian commerce power and i just remind the
[9364.62-9369.09] court that and seventeen ninety and july seventeen ninety congress passes a that essentially
[9369.09-9374.55] delegated to present washington essentially the entire scope of the indian commerce power he
[9374.55-9377.46] said you can do commerce with indians of you have a license
[9378.36-9381.18] that you have to pay a fee for but and that that will be
[9381.18-9385.05] starting to such rules and regulations as the president makes with no further guides
[9385.32-9389.07] so when it comes to this for increasing the autopsy analogous because the indian
[9389.07-9393.60] tribes i've for sovereigns but this for and facing situation we have a very
[9393.98-9398.16] sort of deep and profound historical pedigree who broad delegations of
[9399.00-9402.93] the rate regulation of commerce right before and commerce power in that case you
[9402.93-9406.56] need commerce power and that ties i think do what i i take to
[9406.56-9410.10] be the main theme of the arguments on the other side i think that
[9410.10-9414.24] mr catch i'll start by saying tariffs or taxes and i want to complete
[9414.24-9416.73] the answer i think it was given to the chief justice when i got
[9416.73-9423.33] interrupted his if you look at these these terrorists these policies it is clear
[9423.33-9427.74] that these policies are most effective if nobody ever pays the terror if it
[9427.74-9432.66] never raises a dime of revenue bees are the most effective use of these
[9432.66-9436.53] of this particular policy and i said there's two buckets their won his first
[9436.53-9439.71] of all when it comes to the trade deficit emergency if no one ever
[9439.71-9444.24] pays the tariff but instead they director consumption domestically and spur the creation of
[9444.24-9448.89] the rebuilding of our of of our hello not mean fracturing base that it
[9448.92-9453.06] directly addresses the crisis it's more effective if no one ever pays the terror
[9453.18-9456.21] that's the point of really you know that's a fundamental point of it and
[9456.21-9458.82] that's one piece of these and then as to both of them as a
[9458.82-9464.52] boat of the declared emergencies that terrorists are in incentive a pressure point leverage
[9464.52-9468.21] bargaining chip is the court said in games and more to get countries to
[9468.21-9472.77] change their behavior to address the foreigner rising emergencies so if you look for
[9472.77-9477.18] example to take a historical example one last week's trade or china it unlocked
[9477.18-9481.14] access to rare earth minerals which of course have a critical national security aspect
[9481.14-9484.95] to them and it got china for the very first time to change its
[9484.95-9491.40] policy respect to fentanyl precursors which is a crucial piece of that that those
[9491.40-9495.27] terrorists if no one ever collection with the threat of imposing those terrorists gets
[9495.27-9499.47] china and are other trading partners across the world to change their behaviors in
[9499.47-9503.22] a way that addresses this then that's the most effective use of the pulse
[9503.55-9509.16] so they're clearly regulatory tariffs not texas they are not that they're not an
[9509.16-9513.42] exercise that power to tax the or the exercise that power to regulate foreign
[9513.42-9517.32] cars and that's what the statute as regulate it doesn't say taxes as regular
[9517.68-9520.80] it in for that reason we are squirrel lose in the tradition that was
[9520.80-9526.11] talking about before of very broad historically very broad delegations of the power to
[9526.11-9530.79] regulate foreign commerce to the president because he has inherent article does already in
[9530.79-9534.87] the area of of foreign affairs although not that has to be delegated to
[9534.87-9538.79] him otherwise the delegate delegation be superfluous and for all those reasons we asked
[9538.79-9542.70] the court reversed but the decisions for thank you cancel the case is submitted

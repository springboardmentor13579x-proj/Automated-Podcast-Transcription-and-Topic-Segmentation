[0.00-6.28]  We'll hear argument first this morning in case 24, 1056, RICO versus the United States.
[6.28-7.28]  Mr. Unikowski?
[7.28-10.96]  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
[10.96-17.32]  The question in this case is not whether, but instead how, to hold people accountable
[17.32-20.64]  for absconding from supervised release.
[20.64-25.40]  The text and history of the Sentencing Reform Act establish that Congress intended
[25.40-31.64]  for revocation, not fugitive tolling, to be the means of addressing abscondment.
[31.64-35.60]  To begin with the text, the effect of the government's position is that Ms. RICO was
[35.60-41.16]  subject to the conditions of supervised release for a period exceeding the time specified
[41.16-46.00]  in her judgment, and there's no textual support for that result.
[46.00-51.12]  The government claims that Ms. RICO wasn't serving her sentence at all during the period
[51.12-56.08]  of the abscondment, but that argument cannot be squared with the government's simultaneous
[56.08-62.80]  contention that Ms. RICO violated the conditions of supervised release during that period warranting
[62.80-65.44]  an increased sentence.
[65.44-68.32]  History supports Ms. RICO's position.
[68.32-72.88]  Contrary to the government's contention, there is no common law tradition of fugitive
[72.88-75.20]  tolling for parole.
[75.20-85.00]  But fugitive tolling for parole came to exist via a 1976 statute and a 1983 implementing regulation.
[85.00-91.20]  But in the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress prospectively repealed that statute and enacted
[91.20-97.52]  nothing in its stead for supervised release while leaving it intact for legacy parole cases
[97.52-99.52]  and it remains intact today.
[99.52-105.92]  As a result, Congress has created a two-track scheme, parole with fugitive tolling and supervised
[105.92-111.12]  release without it, and we ask the court to adhere to that dichotomy.
[111.12-112.60]  I welcome the court's questions.
[112.60-118.24]  Well, Mr. Unikowski, the government seems to be arguing, making a simple point.
[118.24-125.52]  How can it be considered supervised release when the absconder is not being supervised?
[125.84-130.00]  Your Honor, I completely understand the intuitive force of the government's argument that the
[130.00-135.80]  essence of supervised release is being supervised, and if a person absconds, they're just serving
[135.80-139.72]  the sentence at all in the same way as a prison escapee isn't serving the sentence
[139.72-140.72]  at all.
[140.72-144.08]  But ultimately, although I understand the intuitive force of that argument at first
[144.08-148.84]  blush, I don't think it carries the day because the government's argument has
[148.84-152.88]  a counterintuitive component of its own, which is that it requires believing that
[152.88-158.40]  not only was Ms. Rico subject to the conditions of supervised release during the entire
[158.40-163.44]  abscaman period, but she actually violated those very conditions during that period,
[163.44-165.56]  warranting her increased sentence.
[165.56-170.20]  So it just seems to me almost tautologically if Ms. Rico violated the conditions of
[170.20-174.64]  supervised release, she must have been serving the very sentence that imposed those
[174.64-178.36]  conditions of supervised release.
[178.36-183.56]  I do understand the intuition underlying the government's argument today that it just
[183.56-187.48]  doesn't really make sense that a person should get credit when they've absconded.
[187.48-192.68]  I get that, but I think that one point that really blunts the intuitive force of the
[192.68-197.96]  government's position is that both parties agree that ultimately the absconder should
[197.96-201.56]  be deprived of credit for the time spent absconding.
[201.56-204.24]  The sole question between the parties today is very narrow.
[204.24-208.80]  In other words, how that deprivation of credit should be effectuated.
[208.80-214.00]  So the way we understand the Sentencing Reform Act, if a warrant, as issues based on the
[214.00-218.92]  abscondment, as occurred in this case, then once the person is apprehended, even after
[218.92-222.84]  the term expires, the person can be brought before the sentencing court and then
[222.84-227.52]  the judge revokes supervised release and strips the person of all credit for time
[227.52-229.40]  served during the absconding period.
[229.40-233.92]  So essentially the judge, rather than stopping the clock, the clock keeps going and
[233.92-236.04]  then the clock is rewound back to the beginning.
[236.04-239.04]  But is it really a credit system, Mr. Junokowski?
[239.04-243.44]  I guess I was a little confused by the government's suggestion, even at the
[243.44-247.36]  beginning of its brief, that what's happening in the supervised release world
[247.36-253.44]  is that the court is depriving the individual of credit for supervised release.
[253.44-259.88]  My understanding is that even when there's a revocation, the person is not
[259.88-262.36]  being deemed as giving credit.
[262.36-267.44]  In other words, when supervised release is revoked and the court sends the person
[267.44-272.08]  back to prison and perhaps imposes another period of supervised release, they
[272.08-277.20]  don't calculate how much supervised release they're going to give based on how
[277.20-278.92]  much was already served.
[278.92-283.72]  You had a three-year period, you absconded after one, so now only two
[283.72-284.52]  is available.
[284.52-289.00]  Really, credit doesn't seem like the right framework to understand what's
[289.00-291.24]  even happening in supervised release.
[291.28-293.68]  I agree with what you said, Your Honor, 100%.
[293.68-298.28]  At the revocation hearing, whatever the person has left to serve just sort of
[298.28-302.48]  goes away and the court imposes a whole new sentence of imprisonment and an
[302.48-306.56]  additional period of supervised release based on the court's assessment of the
[306.56-307.84]  defendant at that time.
[307.84-308.84]  Of the needs, right?
[308.84-312.68]  I mean, the reason why supervised release is sort of fundamentally
[312.68-318.84]  different than parole or probation or imprisonment is because it's not
[318.84-320.32]  imposed for punishment.
[320.32-326.40]  It's supposed to be about helping this person reintegrate into society and the
[326.40-331.76]  amount of time that is necessary to do that is evaluated based on who that
[331.76-335.88]  person is and what they've done, but not based on how much time they've
[335.88-338.28]  previously served in supervised release.
[338.28-339.08]  Yes, that's correct.
[339.08-342.60]  So the government's suggestion in its brief that because she absconded
[342.60-346.68]  for 37 months, she has 37 months left to go, doesn't actually capture
[346.68-349.92]  what happened in this case because those 37 months just went away.
[349.92-353.04]  After the new revocation hearing, the judge imposed whatever sentence
[353.04-354.56]  the judge felt was appropriate.
[354.56-358.48]  The effect of the question presented in this case actually is to consider
[358.48-362.44]  the time spent during abscondment as still subject to the conditions
[362.44-365.60]  of supervised release, which allowed the government to argue that a
[365.60-369.32]  crime committed during that period but after the term expired was a
[369.32-373.20]  violation of supervised release resulting in a heightened guidelines.
[373.24-380.08]  Mr. Unikasky, you said that the problem here results from the Sentencing
[380.08-387.24]  Reform Act, but I wonder and I may be misunderstanding things, so you'll
[387.24-391.96]  correct me if the problem here is not entirely one created by the
[391.96-393.08]  Sentencing Guidelines.
[393.08-395.96]  Suppose the Sentencing Guidelines were not in the picture.
[395.96-400.48]  So your client abscons, therefore she's violated the terms of
[400.52-401.64]  supervised release.
[401.64-405.48]  Therefore, her supervised release is revoked.
[405.48-407.84]  Then the judge has to decide what to do.
[407.84-414.88]  Send her back to prison, impose an additional term of supervised release.
[414.88-419.16]  The statute sets out the factors that are relevant to that consideration.
[419.16-423.40]  We went through those factors last term and it doesn't seem to me that
[423.40-429.12]  what she did after the expiration of the 37 months is any less relevant
[429.12-435.72]  to those determinations than what she did before the expiration of the 37 months.
[435.72-443.44]  So that becomes important, the 37 month point becomes important only
[443.44-451.24]  because the guidelines grade, assign a grade to the nature of the
[451.24-452.64]  offenses that occurred.
[452.64-454.12]  Am I right in all this?
[454.12-455.92]  Yes, I agree with everything you said, Your Honor.
[455.96-459.44]  So we believe that the Sentencing Court does have the authority to
[459.44-463.00]  consider the crime she committed after that time expired as part of the
[463.00-466.68]  discretionary decision as to what sentence she should get after the
[466.68-467.20]  resencing.
[467.20-469.80]  So I don't disagree with anything that Your Honor has said.
[469.80-476.28]  So the only thing that's really at stake here is whether the court will
[476.28-483.36]  consider whether to depart upward from the range that results from the
[483.36-487.20]  grade of the violations that occurred before the 37 months or
[487.20-492.64]  considers whether to depart downward from the grade that would apply if
[492.64-498.36]  the post 37 months violations were occurred, right?
[498.36-504.12]  And all the court has to do is to give respectful consideration to those
[504.12-504.64]  guidelines.
[504.64-506.08]  That's really all that's involved here.
[506.08-506.68]  Am I right?
[506.68-507.92]  On the fact of this case, yes.
[507.92-511.56]  There are other cases in which fugitive tolling matters for other
[511.56-512.08]  reasons.
[512.08-514.80]  But on the facts of this case, you have accurately characterized the
[514.80-516.08]  dispute between the parties.
[516.08-517.44]  Mr. I'm sorry.
[517.44-518.00]  I'm sorry.
[518.00-519.04]  I'm finished.
[519.04-519.88]  Done?
[519.88-520.20]  Yes.
[520.20-521.80]  All right.
[521.80-525.56]  The government worries that, OK, there is tolling if you get a warrant
[525.56-530.44]  within the period that's still before the clock runs, before the 37
[530.44-531.20]  months is out.
[531.20-534.32]  You effectively get tolling under I.
[534.32-536.40]  But they worry that there are going to be some cases where as a
[536.40-540.04]  practical matter they can't get a warrant in time and the period
[540.04-541.60]  will expire.
[541.60-544.60]  Do you have any thoughts or reactions to that?
[544.60-544.88]  Yes.
[544.88-547.52]  I understand that there is a concern that it may be that a
[547.52-552.28]  violation occurs at the very end of the term and it goes undetected and
[552.28-554.44]  the warrant doesn't issue in time.
[554.44-557.44]  But I think fugitive tolling is both too broad and too narrow a
[557.44-559.60]  solution to the problem that you've identified.
[559.60-563.20]  So first of all, I think it's too narrow because that is a
[563.20-566.40]  problem that can arise with any violation late in the term,
[566.40-569.44]  committing a crime, possession of drugs, anything else.
[569.44-571.28]  May escape detection, you're saying?
[571.32-575.52]  Yes, in fact, in some ways, abscolon is the easiest type of
[575.52-576.40]  violation to detect.
[576.40-577.08]  To identify.
[577.08-580.84]  Right, because the abscolon supervisor doesn't answer a
[580.84-584.16]  cell phone and so the probation officer can get a warrant
[584.16-584.64]  right away.
[584.64-588.00]  So if we're concerned about the problem of late in term
[588.00-590.96]  violations, it seems ought to focus only on the one type of
[590.96-593.04]  violation that's easiest to detect.
[593.04-596.04]  I also think fugitive tolling is too broad because it
[596.04-599.44]  applies to supervisors who commit, who abscolon anytime
[599.44-601.84]  in the term and it causes the conditions to essentially
[601.84-605.80]  last forever after the term until the person is apprehended.
[605.80-608.88]  There's also an amicus brief by NACDL, which walks through
[608.88-612.24]  empirically that abscolons tend to occur early in the term.
[612.24-615.44]  So I'm not sure the concern the government identifies has a
[615.44-616.76]  lot of real-world force.
[616.76-619.80]  What about the situation where the person who's on
[619.80-623.24]  supervised release is imprisoned for a state
[623.24-624.20]  offense?
[624.20-629.36]  So the supervised release term is told during that period
[629.36-632.64]  and then when the person is released, the state authorities
[632.64-636.64]  may not notify the federal court that the person has been
[636.64-639.88]  released so no warrant would issue.
[639.88-642.28]  Right, so that is the facts of the SWIC case, which is
[642.28-645.28]  currently pending on certiorary to this court.
[645.28-647.80]  As far as I know, that's the only time that's come up
[647.80-648.88]  since 1984.
[648.88-650.72]  I've looked around, haven't found any other cases with
[650.72-651.44]  that fact pattern.
[651.44-653.20]  So it's an unusual case.
[653.20-657.44]  I think ultimately it's a good idea for federal probation
[657.44-659.84]  officers to maintain contact with state authorities as to
[659.84-662.12]  when the person is released from state prison.
[662.12-665.44]  But I don't think that one singular rather unusual fact
[665.44-668.00]  pattern is a basis to establish fugitive tolling
[668.00-672.52]  across the board for all supervisees.
[672.52-675.76]  I'd like to make a point, if I may, about another reason.
[675.76-681.48]  In the end, it really doesn't matter if they commit a
[681.48-685.36]  new crime, they're subject to arrest and persecution for
[685.36-686.48]  that new crime, correct?
[686.48-689.44]  Yes, in this very case, Ms. Rico was convicted of a drug
[689.44-692.08]  offense in state court and was sentenced to prison time.
[692.08-694.56]  So she was held accountable for that action.
[694.56-697.60]  And as Justice Alito stated, that can also be considered as
[697.60-700.00]  part of the discretionary revocation sentencing.
[700.00-702.92]  It's only a very narrow question of whether that
[702.92-705.96]  offense increases her guidelines range.
[705.96-708.72]  Mr. Unikowsky, it seems that part of the dispute here
[708.72-710.92]  between you and the government has to do with what it
[710.92-714.96]  means to be on a term of supervised release, where
[714.96-717.40]  you say it means being subject to a certain set of
[717.40-718.36]  conditions.
[718.36-721.12]  And the government says, well, it means that, but it also
[721.12-722.28]  means something else.
[722.28-725.32]  It means that you're being supervised, that you're
[725.32-730.12]  being monitored in some way, which does not happen
[730.12-732.40]  when the person has absconded.
[732.40-734.92]  So what do you think of that?
[734.92-739.72]  That the idea of supervised release contemplates a
[739.72-743.64]  level of supervision above and beyond the
[743.64-746.56]  particular conditions of the term.
[746.56-749.40]  I respectfully disagree with the government's argument on
[749.40-753.44]  that score, because I think it improperly decouples the
[753.44-757.24]  burdens imposed by the sentence with how to determine
[757.24-759.56]  whether the person is serving the sentence.
[759.56-762.36]  Ordinarily, those two are flip sides of the same coin,
[762.36-764.20]  like the government talks about the prison case.
[764.20-766.44]  So the burden imposed by the sentence is you have
[766.44-768.60]  to be in prison, and you determine if the person
[768.60-771.28]  satisfying the sentence by checking if the person has
[771.28-772.44]  been in prison.
[772.44-775.00]  But in this case, the burdens imposed by the sentence
[775.00-777.20]  are the conditions in the judgment.
[777.20-780.16]  But the government contends that when determined if it
[780.16-783.12]  one satisfies the sentence based on this concept of
[783.12-785.96]  supervision, which doesn't correspond to any particular
[785.96-787.68]  supervised release condition.
[787.68-789.32]  And because of that decoupling, you have the
[789.32-791.76]  unusual fact pattern in this case, where the
[791.76-794.72]  government contends that Ms. Rico violated the
[794.72-797.00]  conditions of supervised release while not
[797.00-798.48]  serving that sentence.
[798.48-800.72]  I think the court should follow the ordinary practice
[800.72-803.00]  of saying that one determines if one is serving the
[803.00-806.88]  sentence by looking at the binding effect of the sentence.
[806.88-808.72]  I would like to also talk about some additional
[808.72-813.56]  statutory clues that I think militate in Ms. Rico's favor.
[813.56-816.84]  First, I think it's a relevant fact that there's no
[816.84-820.48]  statutory definition of abscondment.
[820.48-822.88]  And I think it's, and in fact, that's a difficult
[822.88-824.60]  concept to define at the margins.
[824.60-828.12]  There's two amicus briefs, the NACDL amicus brief
[828.12-831.44]  and the NAFD amicus brief, that talk in some detail about
[831.44-833.72]  the difficulties courts have had in deciding questions
[833.72-837.08]  like when a violation of supervised release rises to
[837.08-840.48]  the level of an abscondment and also when the clock on the
[840.48-842.60]  abscondment period starts.
[842.60-845.76]  And it does seem unlikely from our perspective that
[845.76-849.92]  Congress would have intended the very basic question of
[849.92-853.04]  when a supervised release term ends to be governed by
[853.04-855.80]  this nebulous and non-statutory abscondment
[855.80-858.52]  standard with judges essentially figuring out the
[858.52-861.32]  answer to these questions on the fly without any
[861.32-862.84]  statutory anchor.
[862.84-864.96]  It just seems more likely from our perspective that
[864.96-867.72]  Congress intended the regime to operate this way.
[867.72-870.92]  The clock keeps going unless it's told under the
[870.92-874.52]  explicit language of section 3624 or until there's a
[874.52-875.72]  revocation hearing.
[875.72-877.96]  At that point, the judge can recognize that it's
[877.96-880.72]  necessary to turn the clock back to the beginning to
[880.72-883.72]  ensure the person actually serves the full term of
[883.72-887.08]  supervised release in contact with the probation officer
[887.08-890.80]  that the court contemplated.
[890.80-893.48]  I'd like to say a few words about history as well.
[893.48-895.64]  I think the historical evidence is quite strongly in
[895.64-896.60]  our favor.
[896.60-898.76]  The government makes the point that there is a strong
[898.76-902.36]  historical tradition that when someone escapes from
[902.36-905.56]  prison, that stops the clock on their sentence, and then
[905.56-908.00]  the clock resumes when they are returned to prison.
[908.00-909.60]  I think that makes sense.
[909.60-912.08]  20 years in prison, you have to actually be 20 years
[912.08-913.36]  physically in prison.
[913.36-915.52]  But I think that the historical evidence really runs the
[915.52-918.32]  other way in terms of fugitive tolling.
[918.32-922.32]  The federal parole statute was first enacted in 1910, and
[922.32-925.24]  then parole was abolished prospectively in 1984.
[925.24-927.44]  And neither we nor the government can come up with
[927.44-930.68]  any cases ever in which the government's fugitive
[930.68-934.52]  tolling rule was applied in the manner the government
[934.52-939.04]  proposes today in which the conditions of parole
[939.04-942.40]  extended after the scheduled expiration of the term.
[942.40-946.24]  And it's not just the absence of evidence of fugitive
[946.24-949.32]  tolling, there's also evidence of absence in the form of
[949.32-952.40]  this 1983 regulation that we cite in the brief.
[952.40-956.20]  So that regulation said that prospectively, based on this
[956.20-961.24]  1976 statute, there will be fugitive tolling of exactly
[961.24-964.76]  the same form that the government advocates in this
[964.76-965.00]  case.
[965.00-967.80]  So in a couple of ways, I think that regulation
[967.80-969.72]  rebuts the notion that there's a tradition of
[969.72-970.80]  fugitive tolling.
[970.80-974.32]  One, it's premised on this 1976 statute, not this
[974.32-976.20]  longstanding common law tradition.
[976.20-979.64]  Two, it's perspective only implying that the rule
[979.64-981.64]  didn't previously exist.
[981.64-985.44]  And third, it's not clear why the parole commission would
[985.44-988.80]  have enacted such a rule if the tradition already existed
[988.80-989.36]  in advance.
[989.36-992.44]  So I think that provides pretty strong evidence that
[992.44-995.00]  this just wasn't thing that parole boards were doing
[995.00-996.44]  until 1983.
[996.44-999.48]  And then in the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984,
[999.48-1003.12]  Congress repeals the statute on which this provision was
[1003.12-1005.44]  based, 4210C.
[1005.44-1007.76]  It enacts no replacement provision.
[1007.76-1011.64]  And meanwhile, Section 4210C is immediately adjacent to
[1011.64-1015.32]  this other statute, 4210B, which enacts a version of
[1015.32-1016.12]  prisoner tolling.
[1016.12-1018.68]  And Congress does reenact that in the Sentencing Reform
[1018.68-1019.28]  Act.
[1019.28-1022.88]  Well, before the abolition of parole with the Sentencing
[1022.88-1025.04]  Reform Act, there were no sentencing guidelines.
[1025.04-1029.00]  So it's not clear to me why it would be relevant, why
[1029.04-1034.28]  court would be concerned about whether the parolee
[1034.28-1037.80]  committed offenses during the period when the parolee was
[1037.80-1041.48]  supposed to be on parole after the expiration of the
[1041.48-1043.44]  parole term or not.
[1043.44-1046.04]  The parolee violates the terms of parole.
[1046.04-1051.64]  When the parolee is apprehended, the court
[1051.64-1054.16]  would revoke parole and then decide what to do.
[1054.16-1056.72]  So why would it be relevant?
[1056.72-1058.56]  Suppose your client were on parole.
[1058.56-1061.96]  Why would it be relevant to determine whether the
[1061.96-1065.12]  additional things that she did while out on parole
[1065.12-1067.76]  occurred before or after the 37 months?
[1067.76-1071.80]  I mean, the 1983 regulation explicitly says that if you
[1071.80-1074.40]  commit the violation after the schedule ending, it will be
[1074.40-1076.20]  considered a violation of parole.
[1076.20-1078.72]  So it's hard to reconstruct exactly what they were
[1078.72-1080.72]  thinking, but presumably it was felt that this was
[1080.72-1084.16]  important enough to encode it in a regulation.
[1084.16-1088.32]  And so Congress had that regulation on its desk.
[1088.32-1091.12]  It was enacted just a year before the Sentencing Reform
[1091.12-1094.56]  Act, and Congress eschewed it in the Sentencing Reform Act.
[1094.56-1097.16]  So I just think that that's at least some amount of
[1097.16-1099.60]  historical consideration is warranted here, especially
[1099.60-1101.88]  since I think what this case boils down to are these
[1101.88-1103.76]  competing intuitions.
[1103.76-1106.12]  The government has this intuition on its side of the
[1106.12-1109.04]  House that it doesn't make sense to say that a person
[1109.04-1111.16]  who isn't supervised is serving a sentence of
[1111.16-1112.44]  supervised release.
[1112.44-1114.20]  And then we have the intuition on our side of the
[1114.20-1116.84]  House that it doesn't make sense to say that someone
[1116.84-1119.04]  could have violated the conditions of supervised
[1119.04-1121.80]  release when they're not on supervised release.
[1121.80-1123.88]  And ultimately it's the Court's job in this case to cut
[1123.88-1125.20]  through that Gordian knot.
[1125.20-1127.20]  And I think rather than kind of wrestling with these
[1127.20-1130.96]  competing intuitions, I think it's wise to look at the
[1130.96-1133.40]  historical tradition here where we see that this just
[1133.40-1135.48]  wasn't happening for the entire history of the
[1135.48-1136.24]  parole statute.
[1136.24-1139.08]  And so the proposition the government claims in this
[1139.08-1141.32]  brief is very obvious, didn't occur to the
[1141.32-1142.76]  Parole Commission at the time.
[1142.76-1144.52]  And so I think the Court should carry that
[1144.52-1145.68]  tradition forward at least.
[1145.68-1149.96]  Do you respond to the other point that the government
[1149.96-1153.16]  makes, the thrust of it being that the Court has
[1153.16-1156.36]  ordered this person to serve, let's say, three year
[1156.36-1159.60]  period of supervised release and they didn't do so?
[1159.60-1162.76]  Why should they get the benefit of running away
[1162.76-1167.04]  or absconding and not having to comply with the
[1167.04-1168.08]  Court's order?
[1168.08-1170.36]  Well, in some way they just shouldn't because at
[1170.36-1172.64]  the revocation hearing the judge is empowered to
[1172.64-1174.96]  rewind the clock and require the person to start
[1174.96-1175.64]  all over again.
[1175.64-1178.16]  So we think there's an alignment between how
[1178.16-1179.84]  abscommon is handled and other types of violations.
[1179.84-1184.48]  You mean that you envision Congress saying for the
[1184.48-1188.72]  absconder the revocation remedy is what we are
[1188.72-1189.72]  imposing here?
[1189.72-1190.52]  That's exactly right.
[1190.52-1192.96]  And that's how it works with other types of violations.
[1192.96-1195.20]  Like it's true that part of the essence of supervised
[1195.20-1197.84]  release is supervision, but part of the essence of
[1197.84-1201.12]  supervised release is also complying with the law.
[1201.12-1204.92]  And yet if a person isn't a conspiracy, say for one
[1204.96-1206.80]  year during the supervised release period, that's
[1206.80-1209.72]  obviously plainly contrary to the spirit and the
[1209.72-1212.00]  letter of supervised release, but the government
[1212.00-1214.08]  does not claim that that stops the clock for the
[1214.08-1214.76]  year.
[1214.76-1217.20]  Instead what happens is a warrant issues, the
[1217.20-1219.52]  person comes to the sentencing court and then
[1219.52-1221.56]  supervised release is revoked, the person goes
[1221.56-1223.44]  back to federal prison and then back on
[1223.44-1227.00]  supervised release and so effectively the person is
[1227.00-1228.96]  stripped of credit for that year but it's done
[1228.96-1231.44]  through the mechanism of revocation and all we're
[1231.44-1233.48]  saying in this case is that the same thing should
[1233.52-1235.76]  happen to abscondment, which after all is just a
[1235.76-1238.00]  different type of violation of the conditions of
[1238.00-1239.00]  supervised release.
[1241.32-1245.04]  Council, that earlier case, SWIFT I think you
[1245.04-1246.12]  said was the name?
[1246.12-1247.88]  Yes, SWIFT from the Fifth Circuit.
[1247.88-1249.48]  I haven't read it, so I don't know anything
[1249.48-1252.92]  about it, but it's not an issue of keeping in
[1252.92-1256.56]  touch with the state authorities.
[1256.56-1258.76]  The warrant of absconding could have been
[1259.72-1264.76]  issued or a warrant should have issued the
[1264.76-1267.64]  moment they learned of the state law conviction,
[1267.64-1268.44]  correct?
[1268.44-1270.04]  Yes, so that case involved a very
[1270.04-1272.48]  idiosyncratic fact pattern of a person who
[1272.48-1274.68]  served a federal prison sentence and then served
[1274.68-1277.08]  a state prison sentence for many years and then
[1277.08-1279.16]  was released and actually did report to his
[1279.16-1281.44]  state probation officer and apparently he
[1281.44-1283.40]  didn't realize and the federal government
[1283.40-1284.80]  didn't realize that he also had to
[1284.80-1287.24]  simultaneously start this term, a federal
[1287.24-1289.48]  supervised release, and apparently no one
[1289.48-1290.48]  from the federal...
[1290.48-1292.00]  Oh, that really is idiosyncratic.
[1292.00-1295.16]  So yeah, so there haven't, I mean, that is just
[1295.16-1296.64]  an unusual case, it happens to be pending
[1296.64-1298.52]  on certioraria right now, but we haven't
[1298.52-1300.80]  found any cases like that since 1984 other
[1300.80-1302.72]  than this one, so, you know, and the
[1302.72-1304.76]  government cites other exotic fact
[1304.76-1306.76]  patterns where a warrant wouldn't issue
[1306.76-1308.40]  during the term, such as if there's an
[1308.40-1310.72]  administrative error in obtaining the
[1310.72-1312.84]  abscondment warrant, and yes, theoretically
[1312.84-1314.88]  that could happen, but, you know, it
[1314.88-1316.44]  doesn't happen very often and in the
[1316.44-1318.80]  ordinary case, like this one, it's
[1318.80-1321.48]  perfectly appropriate for the probation
[1321.48-1322.48]  officer to get a warrant.
[1322.48-1323.76]  In that swift case, you have to deal
[1323.76-1325.40]  with the language of the statute, which
[1325.40-1329.48]  requires a warrant to have issued before
[1329.48-1331.00]  the expiration of the date.
[1331.00-1332.76]  Exactly, but in this case, a warrant did
[1332.76-1334.36]  issue based on the abscondment, and so
[1334.36-1336.20]  we agree the sentencing board absolutely
[1336.20-1337.68]  had the jurisdiction after the
[1337.68-1338.68]  expiration.
[1338.68-1339.68]  All right, thank you, Councillor.
[1339.68-1341.84]  But, okay, yes.
[1341.84-1343.56]  So let me just make one other point
[1343.56-1345.20]  about the structure of the statute
[1345.20-1347.20]  that I think supports our position.
[1347.20-1349.80]  That's rooted in section 3583i, the towing
[1349.80-1351.64]  provision we just talked about.
[1351.64-1353.72]  So that's not only about abscondment,
[1353.72-1355.84]  but absconding is one common scenario
[1355.84-1358.44]  in which that statute would arise,
[1358.44-1360.04]  because the statute says that if a warrant
[1360.04-1362.20]  issues during the term, then the
[1362.20-1364.36]  sentencing court retains jurisdiction
[1364.36-1366.48]  after the expiration of the term to
[1366.48-1368.48]  revoke supervised release.
[1368.48-1370.16]  So ordinarily, you wouldn't have the
[1370.16-1371.68]  situation where the warrant issues
[1371.68-1373.52]  during the term, but the hearing
[1373.56-1375.76]  happens after the term because the
[1375.76-1377.60]  probation officer knows where the
[1377.60-1379.80]  supervisee lives, so the warrant can
[1379.80-1381.80]  be executed very swiftly.
[1381.80-1383.36]  But one situation in which it couldn't
[1383.36-1384.96]  be executed swiftly is when the
[1384.96-1385.96]  person has absconded.
[1385.96-1387.16]  So the warrant issues during the
[1387.16-1389.12]  term, but they can't find the person
[1389.12-1390.84]  until after the term expires.
[1390.84-1392.40]  And yet even in that context, the
[1392.40-1395.80]  way that section 3583i is set up is
[1395.80-1398.28]  it assumes that the term is going
[1398.28-1400.52]  to end, and then after the
[1400.52-1402.64]  expiration of the term, there will
[1402.68-1404.36]  be this revocation hearing that
[1404.36-1406.60]  rewinds the clock to the beginning.
[1406.60-1408.32]  And I do think that's inconsistent
[1408.32-1409.72]  with how the government is looking
[1409.72-1411.32]  at things, which is that the term
[1411.32-1413.60]  never ends once the abscondment
[1413.60-1414.60]  occurs.
[1414.60-1415.76]  And so, you know, that's just an
[1415.76-1417.08]  additional piece of structural
[1417.08-1418.80]  support in the statute that I do
[1418.80-1420.68]  think militates in favor of our
[1420.68-1422.68]  position.
[1422.68-1423.68]  If there's no further questions,
[1423.68-1425.00]  I'm...
[1425.00-1427.00]  Justice Thomas, any further?
[1427.00-1429.00]  Justice Sotomayor?
[1429.00-1431.00]  Justice Capron?
[1431.00-1433.00]  Jackson?
[1433.00-1434.00]  Thank you, counsel.
[1434.00-1436.00]  Thank you.
[1438.00-1439.00]  Mr. Handel?
[1439.00-1440.00]  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
[1440.00-1441.00]  please the court.
[1441.00-1443.00]  A supervisee is not discharging
[1443.00-1445.00]  her term of supervised release
[1445.00-1446.00]  while she is absconding from
[1446.00-1447.00]  supervision.
[1447.00-1449.00]  That common sense intuition is
[1449.00-1450.00]  consistent with the modern
[1450.00-1452.00]  statutory text, with this
[1452.00-1453.00]  court's precedents interpreting
[1453.00-1454.00]  it, and with the uniform
[1454.00-1456.00]  decisional law preceding it.
[1456.00-1458.00]  The supervised release statutes
[1458.00-1460.00]  require that a supervisee shall
[1460.00-1462.00]  be supervised by a probation
[1462.00-1463.00]  officer following her release
[1463.00-1465.00]  from confinement, and they
[1465.00-1467.00]  detail how that active and
[1467.00-1468.00]  ongoing supervision must
[1468.00-1469.00]  proceed.
[1469.00-1471.00]  This court has accordingly
[1471.00-1472.00]  recognized that supervised
[1472.00-1474.00]  release is a system of both
[1474.00-1476.00]  post-confinement monitoring and
[1476.00-1477.00]  post-confinement assistance,
[1477.00-1479.00]  neither of which is possible
[1479.00-1480.00]  when the supervisee's whereabouts
[1480.00-1482.00]  are unknown because she has
[1482.00-1483.00]  been absconded.
[1483.00-1485.00]  A fugitive who deliberately
[1485.00-1486.00]  and successfully evades
[1486.00-1488.00]  supervision, depriving the
[1488.00-1490.00]  court of any information as to
[1490.00-1492.00]  her conduct, condition, and
[1492.00-1493.00]  compliance, is not being
[1493.00-1495.00]  supervised in any sense that
[1495.00-1497.00]  lawyers, legislators, or laymen
[1497.00-1499.00]  would understand that word.
[1499.00-1501.00]  Petitioner's theory that she
[1501.00-1503.00]  was discharging the supervision
[1503.00-1504.00]  component of her judgment
[1504.00-1505.00]  despite being entirely
[1505.00-1507.00]  unsupervised because her
[1507.00-1508.00]  abscondment did not
[1508.00-1509.00]  automatically terminate her
[1509.00-1511.00]  release conditions, misunderstands
[1511.00-1513.00]  the nature of supervised release.
[1513.00-1515.00]  To discharge her term of
[1515.00-1517.00]  supervised release, a supervisee
[1517.00-1518.00]  must be both under the
[1518.00-1519.00]  supervision of a probation
[1519.00-1521.00]  officer and subject to release
[1521.00-1523.00]  conditions, but her defiance
[1523.00-1525.00]  as to the former does not
[1525.00-1526.00]  relieve her obligations as to
[1526.00-1527.00]  the latter.
[1527.00-1529.00]  Just as nothing in the
[1529.00-1530.00]  supervised release statutes
[1530.00-1532.00]  authorizes a supervisee to
[1532.00-1534.00]  earn credit for time spent as
[1534.00-1535.00]  an unsupervised fugitive,
[1535.00-1537.00]  nothing permits her by
[1537.00-1539.00]  means of abscondment to take
[1539.00-1540.00]  a vacation from her court
[1540.00-1542.00]  in order conditions whenever
[1542.00-1543.00]  they prove inconvenient.
[1543.00-1545.00]  Those two intuitive principles
[1545.00-1546.00]  resolve this case.
[1546.00-1548.00]  I welcome the court's questions.
[1548.00-1550.00]  You suggest that without the
[1550.00-1552.00]  tolling, she would
[1552.00-1554.00]  receive an unwarranted benefit.
[1554.00-1556.00]  What exactly is that benefit?
[1556.00-1558.00]  Yes, so I think there are
[1558.00-1560.00]  a couple of possible benefits
[1560.00-1562.00]  that a supervisee would receive
[1562.00-1564.00]  from a period of fugitivity
[1564.00-1566.00]  if you did not apply the
[1566.00-1567.00]  fugitive tolling doctrine.
[1567.00-1569.00]  So it does not apply to
[1569.00-1571.00]  this case, but the most obvious
[1571.00-1573.00]  and most serious benefit
[1573.00-1575.00]  that a fugitive could receive
[1575.00-1577.00]  would be the ability
[1577.00-1579.00]  to just run out the term of
[1579.00-1581.00]  supervised release while she is
[1581.00-1582.00]  absconded.
[1582.00-1583.00]  So in this case, what is the
[1583.00-1584.00]  benefit?
[1584.00-1586.00]  So in this case, the benefit
[1586.00-1588.00]  is essentially that she
[1588.00-1590.00]  avoided the post-confinement
[1590.00-1592.00]  monitoring and surveillance.
[1592.00-1594.00]  So if you have revocation
[1594.00-1596.00]  as a sanction for that,
[1596.00-1598.00]  what is this case about?
[1598.00-1600.00]  Right, so this case, as I believe
[1600.00-1602.00]  Justice Alito pointed out, this case
[1602.00-1604.00]  really boils down to just a disagreement
[1604.00-1606.00]  about the sentencing guidelines.
[1606.00-1608.00]  And candidly, especially given
[1608.00-1610.00]  petitioners' concession that
[1610.00-1612.00]  the court at the
[1612.00-1614.00]  revocation hearing can consider
[1614.00-1616.00]  the full range of conduct
[1616.00-1618.00]  post-dating the abscondment,
[1618.00-1620.00]  we don't think that in the real
[1620.00-1622.00]  world this is going to shake out
[1622.00-1624.00]  to that much of a difference when it
[1624.00-1626.00]  comes to the actual revocation
[1626.00-1628.00]  in the real world.
[1628.00-1630.00]  In the real world, there is
[1630.00-1632.00]  no benefit unless she runs
[1632.00-1634.00]  out the clock before the government gets
[1634.00-1636.00]  a warrant, I think.
[1636.00-1637.00]  Is that right?
[1637.00-1639.00]  I think that is the situation that we
[1639.00-1640.00]  are mostly concerned about.
[1640.00-1642.00]  And if that's the situation you're
[1642.00-1644.00]  concerned about,
[1644.00-1646.00]  it seems to me that it's a very
[1646.00-1648.00]  unlikely scenario to arise,
[1648.00-1650.00]  except for as Mr.
[1650.00-1652.00]  Unikowski says, if the violation
[1652.00-1654.00]  occurs at the very end of
[1654.00-1656.00]  the supervised release period,
[1656.00-1658.00]  it might escape detection.
[1658.00-1660.00]  And similarly, though that's
[1660.00-1662.00]  true with anything,
[1662.00-1664.00]  a supervised release individual
[1664.00-1666.00]  might do any crime here she
[1666.00-1668.00]  might commit, might escape
[1668.00-1670.00]  detection at the end of
[1670.00-1672.00]  that period.
[1672.00-1674.00]  So respectfully, Justice
[1674.00-1676.00]  Gorsuch, I disagree about the
[1676.00-1678.00]  likelihood of the 3583
[1678.00-1680.00]  I mechanism failing, so I think
[1680.00-1682.00]  as has been discussed, we have
[1682.00-1684.00]  a case out of the fifth circuit
[1684.00-1686.00]  where a defendant was serving
[1686.00-1688.00]  a state term of imprisonment and
[1688.00-1690.00]  then did not report to her federal
[1690.00-1692.00]  probation officer as she was directed.
[1692.00-1694.00]  There's the crane case out of the
[1694.00-1696.00]  ninth circuit where a supervisee was
[1696.00-1698.00]  in a residential treatment program
[1698.00-1700.00]  left early and that was not
[1700.00-1702.00]  reported to the probation officer.
[1702.00-1704.00]  But it's also possible a probation
[1704.00-1706.00]  officer will miss other crimes
[1706.00-1708.00]  at the very end of a period.
[1708.00-1710.00]  Absolutely, these were not right
[1710.00-1712.00]  but there are several...
[1712.00-1714.00]  If the government has a problem getting warrants
[1714.00-1716.00]  maybe the government ought to go to
[1716.00-1718.00]  Congress and ask for I to be amended
[1718.00-1720.00]  as it already has once.
[1720.00-1722.00]  Thoughts?
[1722.00-1724.00]  Well, Your Honor, I know
[1724.00-1726.00]  that the government occasionally comes in here
[1726.00-1728.00]  and pleads like resource
[1728.00-1730.00]  constraints and administrative...
[1730.00-1732.00]  That's what this one sounds like to me.
[1732.00-1734.00]  Let me just say with all respect
[1734.00-1736.00]  this process is completely between
[1736.00-1738.00]  the probation office and the
[1738.00-1740.00]  IZ the government does not get involved
[1740.00-1742.00]  in the adjudication stage.
[1742.00-1744.00]  Hold on, the probation officer
[1744.00-1746.00]  isn't a government employee?
[1746.00-1748.00]  The probation officer is a
[1748.00-1750.00]  member of the judicial branch.
[1750.00-1752.00]  I understand that but you're pleading
[1752.00-1754.00]  constraints for the government
[1754.00-1756.00]  in whatever form it may be.
[1756.00-1758.00]  And I appreciate those constraints
[1758.00-1760.00]  but the government's always been able
[1760.00-1762.00]  to go to Congress and in fact did
[1762.00-1764.00]  to amend I once already
[1764.00-1766.00]  Congress has proven pretty solicitous
[1766.00-1768.00]  and alternative is for us to create
[1768.00-1770.00]  a fugitive tolling doctrine
[1770.00-1772.00]  pretty whole cloth and there appear to be
[1772.00-1774.00]  at least two circuit splits.
[1774.00-1776.00]  One about what is required to
[1776.00-1778.00]  abscond. Is it just not showing up
[1778.00-1780.00]  or is it actually being
[1780.00-1782.00]  completely unavailable for supervision?
[1782.00-1784.00]  Another circuit split
[1784.00-1786.00]  over what it means
[1786.00-1788.00]  to be an absconder.
[1788.00-1790.00]  Does it start when the status arises?
[1790.00-1792.00]  Does it start later?
[1792.00-1794.00]  And so we're going to have to come up
[1794.00-1796.00]  with a full common law doctrine here
[1796.00-1798.00]  to supplement what I already says.
[1798.00-1800.00]  Thoughts about that?
[1800.00-1802.00]  Well, Justice Gorsuch, I disagree
[1802.00-1804.00]  on the circuit case law
[1804.00-1806.00]  on what constitutes abscondment.
[1806.00-1808.00]  I think that the courts of appeals
[1808.00-1810.00]  that have adopted are...
[1810.00-1812.00]  I thought the Ninth Circuit said it's
[1812.00-1814.00]  merely failing to appear in the Fourth Circuit
[1814.00-1816.00]  says you have to act in a way that precludes
[1816.00-1818.00]  the government from supervising.
[1818.00-1820.00]  So I think 20 years ago the Ninth Circuit had
[1820.00-1822.00]  one case that said that it could be
[1822.00-1824.00]  anything that violated a release condition.
[1824.00-1826.00]  Since then they have clarified
[1826.00-1828.00]  in Ignacio Juarez that it is actually
[1828.00-1830.00]  a
[1830.00-1832.00]  pattern of conduct that
[1832.00-1834.00]  prevents supervision, that precludes
[1834.00-1836.00]  supervision, and I think that is
[1836.00-1838.00]  fully consistent with what the Fifth Circuit
[1838.00-1840.00]  said in SWIC and the Fourth Circuit said in Thompson.
[1840.00-1842.00]  That's one court's view.
[1842.00-1844.00]  I think the point that Justice Gorsuch
[1844.00-1846.00]  is making is that
[1846.00-1848.00]  we would have to decide
[1848.00-1850.00]  as a matter of common law
[1850.00-1852.00]  which of those approaches is right.
[1852.00-1854.00]  Well, Justice Sotomayor,
[1854.00-1856.00]  the only point that I'm making is that
[1856.00-1858.00]  I believe there is actually a consensus
[1858.00-1860.00]  on what constitutes abscondment in the
[1860.00-1862.00]  courts of appeals that have adopted
[1862.00-1864.00]  our view of how this statutory scale works.
[1864.00-1866.00]  Counsel, statutorily,
[1866.00-1868.00]  supervised release can't go on
[1868.00-1870.00]  for more than five years.
[1870.00-1872.00]  Under your theory of this case,
[1872.00-1874.00]  you're saying
[1874.00-1876.00]  supervised release in part
[1876.00-1878.00]  continues during the time
[1878.00-1880.00]  of abscondment because they're
[1880.00-1882.00]  subject to the
[1882.00-1884.00]  terms that they
[1884.00-1886.00]  violated, and yet
[1886.00-1888.00]  it doesn't run out.
[1888.00-1890.00]  Isn't that us
[1890.00-1892.00]  by common law extending
[1892.00-1894.00]  a period of punishment?
[1894.00-1896.00]  No, Your Honor.
[1896.00-1898.00]  Tell me how not.
[1898.00-1900.00]  If during the
[1900.00-1902.00]  five years
[1902.00-1904.00]  you violate those terms,
[1904.00-1906.00]  you're still under supervised release terms,
[1906.00-1908.00]  if you violate them,
[1908.00-1910.00]  you're claiming
[1910.00-1912.00]  that violation subjects
[1912.00-1914.00]  you to
[1914.00-1916.00]  a new warrant.
[1916.00-1918.00]  How
[1918.00-1920.00]  are we not extending the period?
[1920.00-1922.00]  Justice Sotomayor, a term of
[1922.00-1924.00]  supervised release requires that
[1924.00-1926.00]  the supervisee is both
[1926.00-1928.00]  subject to the conditions.
[1928.00-1930.00]  In fact, it doesn't.
[1930.00-1932.00]  The way the statute is written,
[1932.00-1934.00]  it's up to the sentencing judge
[1934.00-1936.00]  to consider actual supervision
[1936.00-1938.00]  by the probation department's necessary.
[1938.00-1940.00]  I grant you that I think
[1940.00-1942.00]  in virtually all cases,
[1942.00-1944.00]  most judges require it,
[1944.00-1946.00]  but it's not legally required.
[1946.00-1948.00]  Your Honor, I think if we read
[1948.00-1950.00]  supervision out of
[1950.00-1952.00]  supervised release that
[1952.00-1954.00]  essentially renders 18 USC
[1954.00-1956.00]  36.01 and 36.03
[1956.00-1958.00]  but then
[1958.00-1960.00]  what happens to the defendant
[1960.00-1962.00]  who is reporting
[1962.00-1964.00]  this week
[1964.00-1966.00]  doing what he
[1966.00-1968.00]  is supposed to do in terms of reporting
[1968.00-1970.00]  to the agent, but is out there
[1970.00-1972.00]  running a criminal enterprise
[1972.00-1974.00]  every single day.
[1974.00-1976.00]  That person in my judgment
[1976.00-1978.00]  is not being adequately supervised.
[1978.00-1980.00]  That person
[1980.00-1982.00]  is violating the essence
[1982.00-1984.00]  of the supervision,
[1984.00-1986.00]  and yet
[1986.00-1988.00]  you would claim he has an upscounded.
[1988.00-1990.00]  Yes,
[1990.00-1992.00]  he is certainly violating his release conditions,
[1992.00-1994.00]  and I want to be very clear
[1994.00-1996.00]  that we do not view...
[1996.00-1998.00]  That person could be
[1998.00-2000.00]  not
[2000.00-2002.00]  evading the entire
[2002.00-2004.00]  spirit of supervised release,
[2004.00-2006.00]  but that doesn't subject them
[2006.00-2008.00]  to an extended period
[2008.00-2010.00]  of supervised release, does it?
[2010.00-2012.00]  I think the distinction there is that
[2012.00-2014.00]  if that person is actually being supervised,
[2014.00-2016.00]  if their whereabouts are known
[2016.00-2018.00]  to their probation officer,
[2018.00-2020.00]  as required by the terms
[2020.00-2022.00]  of their supervision, then
[2022.00-2024.00]  their violative conduct is much
[2024.00-2026.00]  likelier to actually be detected
[2026.00-2028.00]  and to result in a revocation
[2028.00-2030.00]  hearing and a new sanction.
[2030.00-2032.00]  The reality is that it really is.
[2032.00-2034.00]  I don't know, I mean,
[2034.00-2036.00]  failing to show up is a pretty obvious way
[2036.00-2038.00]  to detect a violation, seems to me,
[2038.00-2040.00]  more so than a lot of other criminal
[2040.00-2042.00]  enterprises that might be going on.
[2042.00-2044.00]  I dutifully show up, but I'm running a
[2044.00-2046.00]  murder and mayhem ink
[2046.00-2048.00]  over here. You just don't find it.
[2048.00-2050.00]  That's hard to find.
[2050.00-2052.00]  You got to go find that.
[2052.00-2054.00]  Somebody that doesn't show up, I notice.
[2054.00-2056.00]  Yes, I agree with that
[2056.00-2058.00]  Justice Gorsuch, but I think
[2058.00-2060.00]  that not showing up
[2060.00-2062.00]  to a meeting is going to get you
[2062.00-2064.00]  maybe a grade C violation
[2064.00-2066.00]  at the most, probably
[2066.00-2068.00]  in most instances will not even be
[2068.00-2070.00]  reported to the district court.
[2070.00-2072.00]  If you are out there running
[2072.00-2074.00]  murder, mayhem ink, or
[2074.00-2076.00]  something like that, I mean, that is obviously
[2076.00-2078.00]  much more serious, egregious
[2078.00-2080.00]  misconduct that we think
[2080.00-2082.00]  if you are actually checking in
[2082.00-2084.00]  with your probation officer, if your probation officer
[2084.00-2086.00]  knows where you live and where you work
[2086.00-2088.00]  and is able to conduct
[2088.00-2090.00]  warrantless searches, as is one of
[2090.00-2092.00]  the standard conditions
[2092.00-2094.00]  of supervised release, that is much
[2094.00-2096.00]  likelier for the probation officer
[2096.00-2098.00]  to actually detect that misconduct,
[2098.00-2100.00]  report it to the district court,
[2100.00-2102.00]  and for that to result in a revocation.
[2102.00-2104.00]  Mr.
[2104.00-2106.00]  Counsel, you say when she
[2106.00-2108.00]  absconds, Ms. Rico
[2108.00-2110.00]  supervision
[2110.00-2112.00]  term doesn't run, but she's still subject
[2112.00-2114.00]  to the requirements and can violate
[2114.00-2116.00]  requirements such as that she has
[2116.00-2118.00]  to report. Now, why isn't
[2118.00-2120.00]  that just like a prisoner
[2120.00-2122.00]  who escapes, and you
[2122.00-2124.00]  would say, okay, he's going to be
[2124.00-2126.00]  not get the prison sentence time
[2126.00-2128.00]  during that period, but
[2128.00-2130.00]  he also violated the rule about
[2130.00-2132.00]  prison inmates can only wear a particular
[2132.00-2134.00]  type of clothing. It seems to me
[2134.00-2136.00]  that is sort of a double
[2136.00-2138.00]  counting. Well, I don't
[2138.00-2140.00]  think so, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, I would
[2140.00-2142.00]  point out that when
[2142.00-2144.00]  prisoners escape, whether it's
[2144.00-2146.00]  from, you know, a physical
[2146.00-2148.00]  BOP institution or
[2148.00-2150.00]  from one of these other forms
[2150.00-2152.00]  of confinement that
[2152.00-2154.00]  BOP has developed like home
[2154.00-2156.00]  confinement, furlough, halfway house,
[2156.00-2158.00]  something like that, they can
[2158.00-2160.00]  be obviously at the moment
[2160.00-2162.00]  of their escape, the clock
[2162.00-2164.00]  stops on service of their term, and
[2164.00-2166.00]  they will have to fulfill
[2166.00-2168.00]  the undischarged portion
[2168.00-2170.00]  of the term when they are recaptured,
[2170.00-2172.00]  but they can also face institutional consequences
[2172.00-2174.00]  for the behavior
[2174.00-2176.00]  that they engage in when they
[2176.00-2178.00]  are on escape
[2178.00-2180.00]  status. I think that... I ask you
[2180.00-2182.00]  and not for the same reason.
[2182.00-2184.00]  I mean, I think both
[2184.00-2186.00]  Justice Sotomayor
[2186.00-2188.00]  and the Chief might be
[2188.00-2190.00]  pointing out that what you
[2190.00-2192.00]  are suggesting is not really a
[2192.00-2194.00]  tolling rule, because
[2194.00-2196.00]  the traditional tolling is that
[2196.00-2198.00]  the clock stops with respect
[2198.00-2200.00]  to the obligation when
[2200.00-2202.00]  you run away, and it picks up again
[2202.00-2204.00]  when you're found again, and what happens
[2204.00-2206.00]  in between, you can't be
[2206.00-2208.00]  held liable for under that
[2208.00-2210.00]  same framework because the clock has stopped.
[2210.00-2212.00]  So it seems to me that what you're
[2212.00-2214.00]  actually asking for is an extension
[2214.00-2216.00]  rule, one that allows for the
[2216.00-2218.00]  obligations to occur throughout
[2218.00-2220.00]  the whole period. When
[2220.00-2222.00]  you're away, when you've
[2222.00-2224.00]  absconded, you say she's still
[2224.00-2226.00]  held to account for
[2226.00-2228.00]  what happens in the context of
[2228.00-2230.00]  supervised release. So that means those
[2230.00-2232.00]  conditions are extending, not
[2232.00-2234.00]  told, right?
[2234.00-2236.00]  So, respectfully, Justice Jackson,
[2236.00-2238.00]  I disagree with that characterization
[2238.00-2240.00]  of it as an extension rule. I think that tolling
[2240.00-2242.00]  in every circumstance is about
[2242.00-2244.00]  stopping the clock, but tolling has
[2244.00-2246.00]  never guaranteed an immediate...
[2246.00-2248.00]  You're not asking for stopping the clock. That's my point.
[2248.00-2250.00]  You're saying the clock is still going,
[2250.00-2252.00]  because that's what allows you to hold her
[2252.00-2254.00]  accountable for the things that happen
[2254.00-2256.00]  during the period when she's away.
[2256.00-2258.00]  We're saying that the clock stops
[2258.00-2260.00]  on service of the term, on
[2260.00-2262.00]  discharging the term of supervised release,
[2262.00-2264.00]  but tolling has never meant an immediate
[2264.00-2266.00]  cessation of any
[2266.00-2268.00]  attendant disabilities or restrictions
[2268.00-2270.00]  that run with the sentence, right?
[2270.00-2272.00]  One big difference is that
[2272.00-2274.00]  you're a fugitive prisoner from
[2274.00-2276.00]  BOP on the Lam,
[2276.00-2278.00]  he might commit a crime, and if he commits
[2278.00-2280.00]  a crime, he's going to get a jury
[2280.00-2282.00]  and a trial.
[2282.00-2284.00]  Whereas if on
[2284.00-2286.00]  supervised release in the abscondment
[2286.00-2288.00]  scenario, your government would assert
[2288.00-2290.00]  the right for a judge
[2290.00-2292.00]  rather than a jury and under
[2292.00-2294.00]  preponderance of the evidence standard
[2294.00-2296.00]  rather than under reasonable doubt standard
[2296.00-2298.00]  address any misconduct during that
[2298.00-2300.00]  period, correct?
[2300.00-2302.00]  Not quite, Justice Gorsuch.
[2302.00-2304.00]  Obviously you are
[2304.00-2306.00]  correct that anytime someone commits
[2306.00-2308.00]  a new crime, if they are going to be
[2308.00-2310.00]  tried for that crime, they get
[2310.00-2312.00]  a jury and all of the
[2312.00-2314.00]  attendant protections of the 6th
[2314.00-2316.00]  and 7th Amendments, but I think
[2316.00-2318.00]  with the example of the
[2318.00-2320.00]  BOP prisoner who's out on the
[2320.00-2322.00]  Lam, to the extent we are applying
[2322.00-2324.00]  BOP institutional consequences
[2324.00-2326.00]  for the behavior that he's
[2326.00-2328.00]  committed, the point is that's separate
[2328.00-2330.00]  from the tolling rule
[2330.00-2332.00]  that we apply to prisoners
[2332.00-2334.00]  who are on the Lam.
[2334.00-2336.00]  That's separate.
[2336.00-2338.00]  I think we view it as
[2338.00-2340.00]  there is the tolling rule.
[2340.00-2342.00]  There is some apparent in the supervised release power
[2342.00-2344.00]  that you say continues but doesn't continue.
[2344.00-2346.00]  I think it's the same thing.
[2346.00-2348.00]  I think we are tolling the
[2348.00-2350.00]  service of the term, but there still
[2350.00-2352.00]  may be additional consequences
[2352.00-2354.00]  that attach for the behavior that occurs
[2354.00-2356.00]  and I'm sorry
[2356.00-2358.00]  Justice Salido.
[2358.00-2360.00]  Well I was just going to ask whether
[2360.00-2362.00]  you think that
[2364.00-2366.00]  the petitioner's argument
[2366.00-2368.00]  is inconsistent with or at least
[2368.00-2370.00]  in tension with our decision
[2370.00-2372.00]  last term in Asteris
[2372.00-2374.00]  which discussed the factors
[2374.00-2376.00]  that are relevant in deciding
[2376.00-2378.00]  whether to
[2378.00-2380.00]  revoke supervised release
[2380.00-2382.00]  and what to do if supervised release
[2382.00-2384.00]  is revoked.
[2384.00-2386.00]  Now I recognize
[2386.00-2388.00]  the factors are discretionary
[2388.00-2390.00]  but still
[2390.00-2392.00]  the petitioner's argument is
[2392.00-2394.00]  that what occurred
[2394.00-2396.00]  after the 37 months
[2396.00-2398.00]  is off the table
[2398.00-2400.00]  and I don't understand
[2400.00-2402.00]  where it is of lesser
[2402.00-2404.00]  significance. It can be taken into account
[2404.00-2406.00]  only through the mechanism
[2406.00-2408.00]  of a departure.
[2408.00-2410.00]  But I don't see what
[2410.00-2412.00]  happened after 37 months
[2412.00-2414.00]  is any less relevant than what happened
[2414.00-2416.00]  before 37 months.
[2416.00-2418.00]  I agree Justice Salido and I think
[2418.00-2420.00]  that what this court said in Asteris
[2420.00-2422.00]  is that courts
[2422.00-2424.00]  at a supervised release revocation
[2424.00-2426.00]  hearing can and should take into
[2426.00-2428.00]  account all of the forward looking
[2428.00-2430.00]  interests that
[2430.00-2432.00]  criminal sentences serve which includes
[2432.00-2434.00]  deterrence, incapacitation,
[2434.00-2436.00]  things like that. I think that
[2436.00-2438.00]  giving supervised release the effect
[2438.00-2440.00]  that Congress wanted meaning that
[2440.00-2442.00]  it is actually
[2442.00-2444.00]  supervision, that it is
[2444.00-2446.00]  the kind of post confinement monitoring
[2446.00-2448.00]  and post confinement assistance that this court
[2448.00-2450.00]  recognized and Cornell Johnson
[2450.00-2452.00]  and Roy Lee Johnson serves those
[2452.00-2454.00]  interests that the court recognized in
[2454.00-2456.00]  Asteris and I don't
[2456.00-2458.00]  quite understand. I think
[2458.00-2460.00]  there is certainly some tension
[2460.00-2462.00]  in the idea that
[2462.00-2464.00]  a person who violates their
[2464.00-2466.00]  supervised release by absconding
[2466.00-2468.00]  is going to be subject to
[2468.00-2470.00]  a sanction
[2470.00-2472.00]  derived from the full breath
[2472.00-2474.00]  of their conduct post-abscondment
[2474.00-2476.00]  but that the guidelines are limited to
[2476.00-2478.00]  just a substance.
[2478.00-2480.00]  What that suggests to me is that this is really
[2480.00-2482.00]  that tolling is a misnomer.
[2482.00-2484.00]  If this were purely tolling
[2484.00-2486.00]  by analogy to the fugitive tolling
[2486.00-2488.00]  role
[2488.00-2490.00]  Petitioner would not have been
[2490.00-2492.00]  on supervised release at all
[2492.00-2494.00]  during the whole period
[2494.00-2496.00]  when she was
[2496.00-2498.00]  absconding but that
[2498.00-2500.00]  she wouldn't be
[2500.00-2502.00]  satisfying her terms, she also wouldn't be
[2502.00-2504.00]  subject to the terms of supervised release
[2504.00-2506.00]  but you don't want that role.
[2506.00-2508.00]  So this doesn't seem to me to be really about tolling
[2508.00-2510.00]  at all. Neither party
[2510.00-2512.00]  really wants a pure tolling
[2512.00-2514.00]  role. It's about what is relevant
[2514.00-2516.00]  what should inform
[2516.00-2518.00]  the decision about what should be done
[2518.00-2520.00]  when there is a revocation.
[2520.00-2522.00]  We think that that is a
[2522.00-2524.00]  distant second best rule.
[2524.00-2526.00]  We would prefer that rule to a rule
[2526.00-2528.00]  of no tolling at all because
[2528.00-2530.00]  as I was discussing I believe with
[2530.00-2532.00]  Justice Gorsuch earlier, our primary
[2532.00-2534.00]  concern here is the idea that
[2534.00-2536.00]  defendants will be able to
[2536.00-2538.00]  abscond from supervision, wait out
[2538.00-2540.00]  the expiration date of their term
[2540.00-2542.00]  and if warrant or summons does not
[2542.00-2544.00]  issue under 3583 I
[2544.00-2546.00]  they will be able to render the
[2546.00-2548.00]  supervision component of their judgment
[2548.00-2550.00]  annulity. That is the worst
[2550.00-2552.00]  outcome here. That does not
[2552.00-2554.00]  serve the system that Congress
[2554.00-2556.00]  enacted. But is that not exactly what
[2556.00-2558.00]  Congress wanted?
[2558.00-2560.00]  The reason why we have
[2560.00-2562.00]  I think is because Congress
[2562.00-2564.00]  suggests that it's only
[2564.00-2566.00]  in the situation in which a warrant does
[2566.00-2568.00]  issue under those
[2568.00-2570.00]  circumstances that the court's
[2570.00-2572.00]  authority can extend to allow
[2572.00-2574.00]  for a revocation.
[2574.00-2576.00]  So I think what you're asking for
[2576.00-2578.00]  seems diametrically opposed to the
[2578.00-2580.00]  policy choice that Congress has made
[2580.00-2582.00]  about the circumstances under which
[2582.00-2584.00]  the person can be held accountable
[2584.00-2586.00]  for something.
[2586.00-2588.00]  I think I part ways with you
[2588.00-2590.00]  on the history and purpose
[2590.00-2592.00]  of subsection I.
[2592.00-2594.00]  Petitioner puts a lot of marbles
[2594.00-2596.00]  in the 3583 I
[2596.00-2598.00]  bucket because that is
[2598.00-2600.00]  essentially the only way that she's
[2600.00-2602.00]  able to get around this
[2602.00-2604.00]  idea that somebody has made out.
[2604.00-2606.00]  That's what Congress says about when
[2606.00-2608.00]  it's extended, when the power
[2608.00-2610.00]  can be extended to hold her accountable.
[2610.00-2612.00]  Well, I would point out just as a
[2612.00-2614.00]  matter of history that subsection I
[2614.00-2616.00]  was not enacted until a decade after
[2616.00-2618.00]  the Sentencing Reform Act. So in
[2618.00-2620.00]  order to buy into her view,
[2620.00-2622.00]  you have to accept the idea that
[2622.00-2624.00]  the Congress that enacted the
[2624.00-2626.00]  Sentencing Reform Act wanted
[2626.00-2628.00]  supervisors to be able to entirely
[2628.00-2630.00]  defeat the supervision component
[2630.00-2632.00]  of their judgment through fugitivity
[2632.00-2634.00]  and waiting out the expiration date
[2634.00-2636.00]  of what they did was
[2636.00-2638.00]  they put the burden on the government
[2638.00-2640.00]  or the probation office to
[2640.00-2642.00]  alert the court and get a warrant
[2642.00-2644.00]  during the time when the person absconded.
[2644.00-2646.00]  But Justice Jackson, there was no 3583
[2646.00-2648.00]  I at that time.
[2648.00-2650.00]  There was no 3583 I, there was no
[2650.00-2652.00]  warrant or summons extension mechanism
[2652.00-2654.00]  for the first 10 years that
[2654.00-2656.00]  the Sentencing Reform Act was in effect.
[2656.00-2658.00]  That was not enacted until 1994.
[2658.00-2660.00]  And your conclusion is then that we have to
[2660.00-2662.00]  now that 3583 I
[2662.00-2664.00]  misinterpret it consistent
[2664.00-2666.00]  with the pre-existing state of affairs.
[2666.00-2668.00]  Well, I have additional reasons
[2668.00-2670.00]  that I think 3583 I
[2670.00-2672.00]  is insufficient, but I do think it's important
[2672.00-2674.00]  to look at the history and think about
[2674.00-2676.00]  what the Congress that enacted the
[2676.00-2678.00]  Sentencing Reform Act was trying to do.
[2678.00-2680.00]  And I think, you know, if
[2680.00-2682.00]  Congress gave district courts for
[2682.00-2684.00]  the first 10 years of the
[2684.00-2686.00]  supervised release system, gave district courts
[2686.00-2688.00]  no tools whatsoever
[2688.00-2690.00]  to go after
[2690.00-2692.00]  responding supervisors who were
[2692.00-2694.00]  able to wait out the expiration date
[2694.00-2696.00]  of their term, I think that that is
[2696.00-2698.00]  very strong evidence that Congress
[2698.00-2700.00]  anticipated that traditional ideas
[2700.00-2702.00]  of fugitive tolling would be incorporated
[2702.00-2704.00]  into the new supervised release system
[2704.00-2706.00]  that they were enacting. But
[2706.00-2708.00]  in terms of, you know, what
[2708.00-2710.00]  I think 3583 I was
[2710.00-2712.00]  going after, I mean
[2712.00-2714.00]  as I think Patricia acknowledged
[2714.00-2716.00]  on page six of her opening brief
[2716.00-2718.00]  and as the second circuit recognized
[2718.00-2720.00]  the Jean Vieille case, this was
[2720.00-2722.00]  really about a very
[2722.00-2724.00]  narrow subset of late breaking
[2724.00-2726.00]  violations where there was not
[2726.00-2728.00]  time left on the clock for the district
[2728.00-2730.00]  court to conduct the
[2730.00-2732.00]  revocation hearing required by
[2732.00-2734.00]  rule 32.1. Every
[2734.00-2736.00]  court to have passed on 3583 I
[2736.00-2738.00]  has talked about this as
[2738.00-2740.00]  being a provision
[2740.00-2742.00]  that is designed just for those very
[2742.00-2744.00]  late end of term
[2744.00-2746.00]  violations. It is not a general
[2746.00-2748.00]  fugitive tolling
[2748.00-2750.00]  provision. I guess Mr.
[2750.00-2752.00]  Handel, though the question to you
[2752.00-2754.00]  is in what provision do you
[2754.00-2756.00]  put your marbles? I mean
[2756.00-2758.00]  in addition to 3583
[2758.00-2760.00]  I, Mr.
[2760.00-2762.00]  Unikowski would say back to you
[2762.00-2764.00]  look, there is no fugitive tolling
[2764.00-2766.00]  provision in this statute of the
[2766.00-2768.00]  kinds that the government wants.
[2768.00-2770.00]  There is tolling
[2770.00-2772.00]  provision in the statute. It applies to
[2772.00-2774.00]  prisoners. It does not apply
[2774.00-2776.00]  to prisoners. There is
[2776.00-2778.00]  in addition a fairly granular
[2778.00-2780.00]  detailed
[2780.00-2782.00]  instructions about what
[2782.00-2784.00]  to do with a person
[2784.00-2786.00]  like the petitioner
[2786.00-2788.00]  here. In other
[2788.00-2790.00]  words there should be a revocation.
[2790.00-2792.00]  There should be a new sentence of
[2792.00-2794.00]  imprisonment with a term of
[2794.00-2796.00]  supervised release attached to it.
[2796.00-2798.00]  The statute offers a solution
[2798.00-2800.00]  for what to do with prisoners
[2800.00-2802.00]  like Ms. Rico.
[2802.00-2804.00]  Are you supposed to look in the statute
[2804.00-2806.00]  for your solution?
[2806.00-2808.00]  I think there are a couple of analytical
[2808.00-2810.00]  questions based into this case.
[2810.00-2812.00]  The first one is just are you serving
[2812.00-2814.00]  a term of supervised release
[2814.00-2816.00]  when you are unsupervised? If you agree
[2816.00-2818.00]  with us on that, that is just about
[2818.00-2820.00]  the basic fundamental
[2820.00-2822.00]  essence of supervised release
[2822.00-2824.00]  looking at the full range of statutes
[2824.00-2826.00]  that Congress enacted here
[2826.00-2828.00]  3601, 3603, 3624e
[2828.00-2830.00]  and saying
[2830.00-2832.00]  Congress anticipated that when someone
[2832.00-2834.00]  is sentenced to a term of supervised release
[2834.00-2836.00]  they will actually be supervised
[2836.00-2838.00]  by a probation officer. If you agree
[2838.00-2840.00]  with us that you have to actually be
[2840.00-2842.00]  supervised to be discharging
[2842.00-2844.00]  a term of supervised release, then you've already
[2844.00-2846.00]  disagreed with petitioner's position
[2846.00-2848.00]  and then we just get to the secondary
[2848.00-2850.00]  question of, okay what do we do
[2850.00-2852.00]  with these release conditions after
[2852.00-2854.00]  abscondment? I'm happy to talk about that
[2854.00-2856.00]  and why I think that abscondment should not
[2856.00-2858.00]  If I take your argument right, that suggests
[2858.00-2860.00]  that the only statutory provision you're
[2860.00-2862.00]  pointing to is the one that identifies
[2862.00-2864.00]  the person who actually does
[2864.00-2866.00]  the supervision. Is that correct?
[2866.00-2868.00]  I think 3601 imposes
[2868.00-2870.00]  an obligation on
[2870.00-2872.00]  a supervisee to be
[2872.00-2874.00]  supervised and 3603 imposes
[2874.00-2876.00]  an obligation on the probation officer
[2876.00-2878.00]  to supervise. I think those work together.
[2878.00-2880.00]  It's pretty
[2880.00-2882.00]  bare bones, yeah?
[2882.00-2884.00]  You know, respectfully I disagree
[2884.00-2886.00]  with that characterization Justice Kagan
[2886.00-2888.00]  and I think
[2888.00-2890.00]  I will acknowledge that
[2890.00-2892.00]  there is not an explicit
[2892.00-2894.00]  fugitive tolling
[2894.00-2896.00]  provision in the Sentencing
[2896.00-2898.00]  Reform Act or any of the amendments
[2898.00-2900.00]  akin to the carceral tolling
[2900.00-2902.00]  There's a lot of detail about what the supervision
[2902.00-2904.00]  looks like, so to the extent that
[2904.00-2906.00]  you're putting all your marbles in this idea
[2906.00-2908.00]  of supervision, I mean the statute
[2908.00-2910.00]  basically says go get supervised.
[2910.00-2912.00]  I mean I think 18 USC
[2912.00-2914.00]  3603 actually puts some meat on the bones
[2914.00-2916.00]  of what supervision should look like.
[2916.00-2918.00]  I grant that that is
[2918.00-2920.00]  oriented toward probation officers
[2920.00-2922.00]  rather than the supervisee
[2922.00-2924.00]  herself, but I think that that tells
[2924.00-2926.00]  us what Congress thought
[2926.00-2928.00]  supervision would look like in practice
[2928.00-2930.00]  and what kinds of requirements
[2930.00-2932.00]  for monitoring, reporting,
[2932.00-2934.00]  assistance, Congress was trying to
[2934.00-2936.00]  bake into this system.
[2936.00-2938.00]  Just to get to the
[2938.00-2940.00]  3624e carceral tolling provision
[2940.00-2942.00]  I think as we pointed out in our brief
[2942.00-2944.00]  Congress had a very good reason
[2944.00-2946.00]  for explicitly addressing
[2946.00-2948.00]  that and it's because there was a
[2948.00-2950.00]  disagreement in the case law as to
[2950.00-2952.00]  whether you would
[2952.00-2954.00]  toll for terms of
[2954.00-2956.00]  incarceration that arose
[2956.00-2958.00]  during a period of supervision
[2958.00-2960.00]  but were based on conduct that predated
[2960.00-2962.00]  the term of supervision
[2962.00-2964.00]  so they couldn't quite be
[2964.00-2966.00]  tethered to a violation of supervision
[2966.00-2968.00]  in the way that this court
[2968.00-2970.00]  treated
[2970.00-2972.00]  the interruption in Anderson
[2972.00-2974.00]  vs. Corral and Zerps vs. Kidwell
[2974.00-2976.00]  Congress resolved that judicial
[2976.00-2978.00]  disagreement in favor of more tolling
[2978.00-2980.00]  I don't think that that tells
[2980.00-2982.00]  us much of anything about
[2982.00-2984.00]  what they thought about fugitive tolling
[2984.00-2986.00]  certainly it doesn't foreclose
[2986.00-2988.00]  the existence of fugitive tolling in the
[2988.00-2990.00]  sentencing reform act.
[2990.00-2992.00]  Just ask you one quick question about your
[2992.00-2994.00]  supervision issue. Suppose we have a defendant
[2994.00-2996.00]  who's in a coma.
[2996.00-2998.00]  Are they being supervised?
[2998.00-3000.00]  Does the sub-scan meant the only thing
[3000.00-3002.00]  that triggers your argument that
[3002.00-3004.00]  the person is not being supervised?
[3004.00-3006.00]  I think there are any number of situations
[3006.00-3008.00]  we could imagine
[3008.00-3010.00]  a comatose supervisee
[3010.00-3012.00]  a lazy or incompetent probation
[3012.00-3014.00]  officer, anything like this
[3014.00-3016.00]  where supervision is not occurring
[3016.00-3018.00]  in the way that Congress
[3018.00-3020.00]  would warrant
[3020.00-3022.00]  an extension of the supervised release.
[3022.00-3024.00]  No, Your Honor.
[3024.00-3026.00]  I do think
[3026.00-3028.00]  I think the text gets us 98%
[3028.00-3030.00]  of the way it gets us to the
[3030.00-3032.00]  two-yard line in terms of what counts
[3032.00-3034.00]  as supervision or not and then
[3034.00-3036.00]  the last couple of yards
[3036.00-3038.00]  have to incorporate background
[3038.00-3040.00]  principles from the
[3040.00-3042.00]  pre-existing case law and there
[3042.00-3044.00]  I think you would look at
[3044.00-3046.00]  against whom do we tax this
[3046.00-3048.00]  failure of supervision. We recognize
[3048.00-3050.00]  that this is not the system operating
[3050.00-3052.00]  as Congress designed it. Maybe the probation
[3052.00-3054.00]  officer is not meeting the
[3054.00-3056.00]  duties imposed on him in
[3056.00-3058.00]  3603. Maybe the supervisee
[3058.00-3060.00]  is not doing what she's technically
[3060.00-3062.00]  required to do under the terms of the judgment
[3062.00-3064.00]  but how do we tax that failure?
[3064.00-3066.00]  And I think that the
[3066.00-3068.00]  lower courts that have adopted our view
[3068.00-3070.00]  of this statutory scheme have gotten
[3070.00-3072.00]  it right when they've said
[3072.00-3074.00]  that a supervisee
[3074.00-3076.00]  obsconds, that a supervisee
[3076.00-3078.00]  is told for her
[3078.00-3080.00]  undischarged term of supervised release
[3080.00-3082.00]  when she deliberately renders supervision
[3082.00-3084.00]  at all. You would not be able to
[3084.00-3086.00]  satisfy the mens rea requirement
[3086.00-3088.00]  as to a comatose supervisee
[3088.00-3090.00]  or as to any situation in which
[3090.00-3092.00]  the probation officer rather than the
[3092.00-3094.00]  supervisee was at fault for the lack
[3094.00-3096.00]  of supervision. Thank you.
[3096.00-3098.00]  Thank you council.
[3098.00-3100.00]  Anything further?
[3100.00-3102.00]  Thank you.
[3102.00-3104.00]  Thank you. Unikowski, rebuttal.
[3106.00-3108.00]  Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
[3108.00-3110.00]  I first want to address Justice
[3110.00-3112.00]  Alito's question about the possibility
[3112.00-3114.00]  of true tolling under which
[3114.00-3116.00]  during the abscommon period the person wouldn't
[3116.00-3118.00]  be subject to the conditions at all.
[3118.00-3120.00]  First of all, if that were the rule then
[3120.00-3122.00]  Ms. Rico would prevail in this case because
[3122.00-3124.00]  the government's case hinges on Ms. Rico
[3124.00-3126.00]  having violated the conditions of
[3126.00-3128.00]  supervised release during that period.
[3128.00-3130.00]  But second, we respectfully disagree with that rule
[3130.00-3132.00]  as inconsistent with the judgment. The judgment
[3132.00-3134.00]  does say that when the sentence
[3134.00-3136.00]  expires Ms. Rico will be subject
[3136.00-3138.00]  to X number of months of supervised release.
[3138.00-3140.00]  I think what that means is that when Ms.
[3140.00-3142.00]  Rico was released from prison she serves
[3142.00-3144.00]  X number of months of supervised release
[3144.00-3146.00]  and that doesn't stop because Ms.
[3146.00-3148.00]  Rico makes the unilateral decision to
[3148.00-3150.00]  abscond.
[3150.00-3152.00]  I'd like to talk about Section 3583 I.
[3152.00-3154.00]  As council mentioned that statute was
[3154.00-3156.00]  enacted in 1994 and the
[3156.00-3158.00]  reason it was enacted is that there were
[3158.00-3160.00]  administration problems prior to the
[3160.00-3162.00]  enactment of that statute. Several courts
[3162.00-3164.00]  invented these judge made rules to try
[3164.00-3166.00]  to get around them. Finally Congress
[3166.00-3168.00]  solved the problem of Section 3583 I
[3168.00-3170.00]  but I think it's notable that
[3170.00-3172.00]  Congress enacted the statute with a very
[3172.00-3174.00]  reticulated language that self-consciously
[3174.00-3176.00]  departed from the parole equivalent
[3176.00-3178.00]  Section 4210C. It specifically
[3178.00-3180.00]  required that the warrant issue
[3180.00-3182.00]  during the term and only then
[3182.00-3184.00]  was jurisdiction extended until after
[3184.00-3186.00]  the term. So that would have been a perfect
[3186.00-3188.00]  opportunity for Congress to enact the
[3188.00-3190.00]  same type of fugitive tolling rule that already
[3190.00-3192.00]  existed for parole. Congress's
[3192.00-3194.00]  decision not to do that I do think sheds
[3194.00-3196.00]  a light on the question presented here.
[3196.00-3198.00]  I want to say a word about Section
[3198.00-3200.00]  3601 the statute that
[3200.00-3202.00]  says that the supervisor shall
[3202.00-3204.00]  be supervised which council characterizes
[3204.00-3206.00]  getting the government 98%
[3206.00-3208.00]  there to the two yard line.
[3208.00-3210.00]  I don't think that statute is very helpful to
[3210.00-3212.00]  the government. All it says is that the
[3212.00-3214.00]  person shall be supervised. Moreover
[3214.00-3216.00]  that's just a prefatory provision
[3216.00-3218.00]  in a portion of the US code addressing
[3218.00-3220.00]  the duties of probation officers
[3220.00-3222.00]  that appears in Section 3601.
[3222.00-3224.00]  The next section is about how probation
[3224.00-3226.00]  officers are appointed and then the next
[3226.00-3228.00]  section after that concerns the duties
[3228.00-3230.00]  of probation officers. So I think it's hard
[3230.00-3232.00]  to read that as recognizing a fugitive
[3232.00-3234.00]  tolling doctrine. It says nothing
[3234.00-3236.00]  about tolling, nothing about
[3236.00-3238.00]  extending the sentencing court's jurisdiction,
[3238.00-3240.00]  nothing about stripping people of credit
[3240.00-3242.00]  and those are all topics that are addressed
[3242.00-3244.00]  in other portions of the sentencing
[3244.00-3246.00]  reform act that do not enact
[3246.00-3248.00]  the government's proposed rule.
[3248.00-3250.00]  Ultimately this case boils down to the
[3250.00-3252.00]  decision that there's just no statutory
[3252.00-3254.00]  support for the government's claim
[3254.00-3256.00]  that Ms. Rico could have been simultaneously
[3256.00-3258.00]  on supervised release
[3258.00-3260.00]  for purposes of finding a violation
[3260.00-3262.00]  of the conditions but off
[3262.00-3264.00]  supervised release for purposes
[3264.00-3266.00]  of determining whether she was serving her
[3266.00-3268.00]  sentence. Because there's no textual
[3268.00-3270.00]  support for fugitive tolling
[3270.00-3272.00]  we would ask the court to reverse the
[3272.00-3274.00]  judgment below. Thank you.
[3274.00-3276.00]  Thank you council. The case is submitted.

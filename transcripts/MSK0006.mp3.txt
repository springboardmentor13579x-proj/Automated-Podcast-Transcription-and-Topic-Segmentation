Just with the drop-offs that I make driving, I do have to make some pretty long hauls back and forth. So, yeah. And where do you currently live? So I live in a house with my wife, yeah, and son. Okay, all right. And okay, so now I'm just gonna move on to the post-program part of this, and I'm gonna ask you to do a few things, okay? So, just by looking at your lights or if you have a mirror, and you can look at your right butt-off area, do you see any swelling or redness? No, I don't see anything like that. And does it feel hot? No, it doesn't feel hot. And do you see any skin changes? No skin changes. Any acne or deformity in the area? No. Has your date changed? Like, are you limping, hobbling, and coming back? Yeah, I feel like I've been limping a little bit, yeah. Are you putting more pressure on the left side then? I am, yeah, yeah. I guess it's a bit of a healthy date. Okay, all right. And then, if you press down on your hip bone, do you feel any pain there on your right hip bone? No, I don't. How about when you press down on your butt-off area? Yeah, there is a little bit of tenderness over the butt-off area. How about the back of your legs? No. How about the front of your legs? No. All right. And then I'm gonna just get you to do a few movements with me as well. Would you, okay, so are you sitting down right now? Yeah. Would you mind standing up from the sitting position? Yeah, for sure. Does that hurt? Yeah, that causes pain. Okay, so that causes, so on hip extension, that causes some pain, as well as knee extension. So would you mind kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go? Mm-hmm. Does that hurt? Oh yeah, it does, yeah. Okay, so right hip flexion also causes pain. And then would you mind folding your knees backwards and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt? No. Okay, so no pain on knee flexion. And how about when you point your feet and toes up towards the ceiling? Yeah, I do get some pain in my, yeah, when that's all straightened out, yeah. Okay, so some pain on plantar flexion of the right foot and how about if you point your feet and toes towards the ground? No pain there. Okay. All right, and how about when you kick your legs to the side and upwards? Oh, no pain with abduction. Oh, so no pain on right hip abduction and then how about when you bring it back down? No. Okay, and no pain on hip abduction. Okay, well those are all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions from myself? Just wondering about possibly what it could be. Yeah, so it sounds right now like you may have some sort of sacral nerve radiculopathy or like a lower lumbar radiculopathy. Basically, that's known as sciatica where your nerve roots can be compressed causing these symptoms. And to diagnose these things, usually it's done by history and physical exam. But if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags including numbness in the groin area, bowel and bladder incontinence, then we can look at some imaging for the spine including MRI. And so in terms of management of this, we can try a couple of conservative approaches first so that includes taking NSAID for the pain and then activity modification. If you're sitting down all the time, perhaps like taking a little break, stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well during those breaks in health. As well, I'm gonna give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and slowly increase those exercises. And if those still don't work, we can try steroids, steroid injections, as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about six to eight weeks. Does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good, thank you. Okay, yeah, no problem.

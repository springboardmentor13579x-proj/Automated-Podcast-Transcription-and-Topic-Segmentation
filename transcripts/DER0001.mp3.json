  "text": " Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man coming in. I'm worried there's a little rash on my leg. I'm getting nervous about. Hi. So you I understand you have a rash on your leg. I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it's more hurts than anything. Okay. How long have you been going on for? It's been it's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes. It started hurting yesterday. It's sort of looking strange and I just wanted to come in to get a check-dow. Okay. When you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that? It looks swollen. It looks bigger than it did before. I mean, or if that makes sense. swollen. Okay. Is it red? Yeah, it's red. It's turning more red kind of in the area around it. I've got these I got these scabs. I've got diabetes and dogs. Actually the best with it. I'm in scratch at it. And normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking. There's no other word for it. Okay. Have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you've kind of just said that you didn't, but I'll double check. No, no. Well, I've had occasional ulcers and sometimes I've banged my toe. Not exactly the best taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gone something that I don't know. I've just never seen it before. Do you have any ulcers right now on your feet? I think so. One of the last times I saw the family dog. I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing all right. Okay. And what legs are you having this problem with right now? So my right, so my ankle. Okay. How have your sugar has been controlled recently? I stopped measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think my A1C last time was like nine, nine something. I'm trying to try and better to be with it. This is hard with work, you know? For sure, I can imagine. So in general, even if you don't know your numbers for your sugar, have you felt? Worst and usually lately have you felt run down at all? Yeah, actually I have. King more. Feel hungry. Sometimes it's tired, but. I know it's hard to tell there's an off lock going on in my life right now. The kids, but. It's hard to tell. I think yeah, I need to see my family dog. Okay. Definitely, you know, a good, a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things. But I'm glad you came in today so we can, you know, I'm going to get you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms? Symptoms, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started, it's, it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the. One of what used to be a scab. So now like kind of open room now. Okay, so when did you start feeling hot? Honestly last 12 hours. Okay, you take your temperature at all. No, I don't have a thermometer at home. So you had any difficulty breathing? No, no. And you chest pain. No. Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left? Yeah, yeah, it does actually changing socks the other day. Yeah. Hey, have you like, have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all? Aside from just feeling a little crummy last couple of weeks, no. Don't really less energy today, but I was up last night thinking about this. Yeah, wanted to come in and talk. Okay, guys, I'm, if you did the right thing, I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your leg worse when you catch it? Yeah, maybe not so much when I touch it, when I walk with it and I start flexing it. It doesn't like that. Okay. Okay. Just resting it right now. It feels fine. It's okay. Okay, well, I'm going to, if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg, I will go back to it. But I'm going to move on and ask you two questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you, you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with? On a condition. See the family talk about cholesterol, want to pill for that. Had asthma as a kid. Not too much of an issue now. And my back, I've had back pain for last 10 years, but I don't know, I really take for his Tylenol Advil for that. Okay. My other question about your leg was, uh, did you lost any feeling in it? It kind of like a doll ache sometimes when I touch it, but no, I like in the area, the ankle, no, but definitely on my feet, like over the years, I've noticed I feel less on it. I don't know what I did previously. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, uh, sorry, I kind of sidetracked to there. So we talked about diabetes. You said you have my cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking? I've taken four pills right now. Okay. So, um, is for the cholesterol. I think it's called. Resuva. Resuva, sadden. Um, the other three, they're all diabetes medications, but I don't remember. Metform is one of them. Uh, sit, uh, sit, uh, I have a list somewhere. I'll give it to you later. Okay. Are you on insulin right now? No. Um, are you on any, or any medication new? Can you reason me? No, no, I've had them for about a year now. Uh, do you have any allergies? Um, yeah, I do actually kind of selling. Can't take that. And what happened when you take kind of selling? It's been a while as a kid. Apparently, like, face got bloated. Was just have a hard time breathing. Um, I think it's been a while. Um, I think it's been a while. Okay. Well, we'll make sure that we don't give you that. Um, can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery? Uh, yeah. Uh, what was it? Um, I had, uh, my sinuses. Had some pretty bad sinusitis. When I was in my teens and they went in kind of carved a little bit of space out. Okay. Um, is that the only third or eight? Yep. Um, and can you tell me do you have any family history of? I need to use in problem anything else stands out to you. Yeah, I'm side of the family. Everyone has diabetes high blood pressure cholesterol. That side of the family is pretty healthy. Um, I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, but she's a pretty big smoker too. Okay. Uh, and I'm just gonna ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Uh, so you said that you have children? Yeah, I do. You live in town. Do you live with your kids? Uh, I live in town. I see my kids over two weeks. And what do you do for work? Did I already ask you this? Uh, no, I'm currently unemployed. I'm looking for work partially employed. I suppose you should say it for my own business. I see. And what do you, uh, what do you do when, uh, when you are working ideally? I'm working in a county. Okay. And, uh, do you smoke? Um, yeah, once in a while. Yeah. I'm stressed, though. Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more maybe like two packs a week. Okay. Do you drink alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. How much do you typically drink? Uh, I think it's about three or four days a week. I think it's about three or four days a week. Maybe a two four. So maybe like three for day or something like that. If you were to average it out. Yeah, if you average it out, I mainly go to the two four a weekend to be honest. Oh, I see. Okay. More so on the weekend. So maybe a little bit more than three for day back in on those days. Okay. I'm going to ask you guys a little bit about the other things that I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Um, did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward with the physical experience? No, I just want to get this figured out. Yeah, we'll definitely do that for you. So, yeah, I'm going to have a look at it and then after that, I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with. And we'll see what we can do for you. Thank you, Doc. Yeah, sounds great. Awesome. Okay. Thanks.",

No, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. Any recent travel? Nope, I've been at home. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for yourself? No, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my elbow. Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called lateral epithondylitis. So it's also known as tennis elbow. And there are a lot of things that predispose you to this. So it could be like a repetitive strain at work, and like continued contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. So for this, we basically recommend a couple of things to manage the pain. But first, in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary, but it doesn't seem like there was any trauma, and I'm not too worried about any fractures. So to help you treat this, we recommend some activity modifications. So at work, not do things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those extensor forearm muscles. And then you can use a compression sleeve as well. Continue taking Tylenol or Amp Feds for the pain. And really important is physical therapy to increase mobility and strength in that arm. And as well, you can apply things like ice to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most. But normally it does go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints and features to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. Yeah.

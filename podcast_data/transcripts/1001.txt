Ted Talks are recorded live at the Ted Conference and partner events. This episode features musician Andrew Bird. Here's Andrew Bird. Well, there's lots to talk about, and I think I'm just going to play to start on. So, feed the fishes. Sing me happy birthday. The luck it's going to be. Here are the... Chaotic All right. So I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's a few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half finished. I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it, because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. So this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here. They're feedback loops. And in the audio world, that's kind of, that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. I'm going to demonstrate for you. I'm not going to hurt you. This is loop feedback. All right. I don't know if that was necessary, but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction. And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms from, say, the ecological. There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. So you can't feed cows their own brains, or you get mad cow disease, and inbreeding, and incest, and let's see. What's the other one? Biological. There's autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself, little two overzealously, and destroys the host, the person. And then, okay, this is where we get to the song, kind of bridges the gap to the emotional, because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. But so I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so I don't know if you've ever had this, but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That sort of feels like to me. It's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. But it's impossible, of course, to see themselves, but they seem to be trying. And so that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. And then, or yours being able to hear themselves. It's just, it's impossible. That's the thing. And so I've been working on this song that mentions these things. And then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves. If that's possible, and that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet. Go ahead and congratulate yourself. Give yourself a hand. The hand is your hand. And the eye that I, as itself is your eye and the ear that hears it self is near. Because it's your ear. Oh, you're done, the impossible now. Took yourself apart. You made yourself and vulnerable. No one can break your heart. So you wear it out. You ring it all, and you wear it all, and you break it yourself. Ring it your own, and you break it yourself. Ring it your own, and you break it yourself. Thanks. It's kind of cool. Like songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now. Just a little bit of... I'm going to finish up with a song I'm called Weather Systems. Quiet, quiet down she says. Speaking to the back of his head on the edge of a bed I can see your blood flow I can see your... ...cells grow. Hold still, while don't spill the wine. I can see it all from here, I can see your heart can see. Weather Systems are the world. Oh, Weather Systems are... Oh... Something's just an opposite. I would hold it where all free agents of some substance are. I can see it all from here, I can see your heart can see. Weather Systems are... The world. The world. The world. The world. The world. The world. Weather Systems are... ... ... ... ... Thanks. That was Andrew Bird recorded at TED 2010 in Long Beach, California, February, 2010. For more information on TED, visit TED.com.

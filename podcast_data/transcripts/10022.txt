Ted Talks are recorded live at the Ted Conference and partner events. This episode features musician Andrew Bird. Here's Andrew Bird. Well, there's lots to talk about, and I think I'm just going to play to start on. When I wake up, in the morning, in the morning, in the morning, in the morning, in the morning, in the coffee, I read the paper, and then I slowly, and so softly. To the dishes To feed the fishes Sing me happy birthday Like it's gonna be Here on earth Yeah Alright, so I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's a few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half finished. I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. So this is basically a song about loops, not the kind of loops that I make up here. Or feedback loops. And in the audio world, that's kind of, that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. I'm going to demonstrate for you. I'm not going to hurt you, though. This is loop, feedback loop. This is loop, feedback loop. This is loop, feedback loop. This is loop, feedback loop. Alright, I don't know if that was necessary. But my point is it's the sound of self-destruction. And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms from the, say, the ecological, okay? There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly. So like you can't feed cows their own brains and you get mad or you get mad cow disease and inbreeding and incest and let's see, what's the other one? Biological, there's autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself, little two over zealously and destroys the host, the person. And then, okay, this is where we get to the song, kind of bridges the gap to the emotional because although I've used scientific terms and in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. But so I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so I don't know if you've ever had this but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That sort of feels like to me, it's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. But it's impossible, of course, to see themselves but they seem to be trying. And so that's getting a little more closer to like a personal experience and then, or yours being able to hear themselves, it's just, it's impossible. That's the thing. So I've been working on this song that mentions these things. And then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves. If that's possible and that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet. Go ahead and congratulate yourself. Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand. And the eye that eyes itself is your eye. And the ear that hears itself is near. Because it's your ear. Oh, you're done the impossible now. Took yourself apart. You made yourself and bone a road bone. No one can break your heart. So you wear it out and you ring it out and you wear it out and you break it yourself. Ring it, you're wrong, ring it, you said Ring it, you're wrong, ring it, you said the Thanks. All right. It's kind of cool. Like songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You don't really have to, you can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But you know, I think reckless curiosity would be my what the world needs now. It's a little bit of... I'm going to finish up with some of my own cold weather systems. Quiet down, she said. Speaking to the back of his head on the edge of a bed I can see your blood flow I can see your Sells grow Holes still a while don't spill the wine I can see it all from here I can see your heart can see Where the systems are the world Where the systems are Where the systems are Something's just an opposite I would hold it where all free agents of some substance So, I can see Maybe I don't spill the wine I can see it all from here I can see your heart I can see Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Where the systems are Thanks.

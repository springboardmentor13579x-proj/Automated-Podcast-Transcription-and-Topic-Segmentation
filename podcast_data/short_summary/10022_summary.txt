 This episode features musician Andrew Bird . Bird plays a song about loops, not the kind of loops that I make up here or feedback loops . Bird: "I've been working on this song that mentions these things. And then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves. If that's possible and that's what the song is asking. All right. Go ahead and congratulate yourself. Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand."

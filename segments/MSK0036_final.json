Okay, and when did this pain start, and is it the right hand or left hand? It's the right hand, but I also find it's starting to happen in the left hand as well. But more so on the right hand, I feel this kind of sensation over my palms and fingers. It started, I would say probably two weeks ago. And I think it's gradually been getting worse. Having more difficulty at night time, especially um it's uh also waking me up from sleep and it's yeah, just affecting my daily routine, my work. So yeah, I just wanted to understand what was going on. Okay, I see. And did you have any trauma to the wrist or any injury or have you had an injury in the past? No, I haven't had any falls, no accidents, nothing like that. Okay, um, and are you right or left handed? I'm right handed. Okay, and you mentioned it was the right hand that started to hurt first, and then the left one has started since then. Yeah, and I don't know if it's just because I use my right hand more than I feel more pain and the symptoms, but yeah, I definitely would say it's worse. Okay, and where are you finding that the pain is specifically located? So the pain I feel like it's more like a discomfort just over the like near the wrist and the lower palm area is where the discomfort is and then the numbness and tingling is just like in my thumb in the first two digits.

No, and are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of the joints in the hand, maybe, like, just a little bit, like, I feel like I've lost some of, like, the fat pad, just right near my phone. I see. Okay. Um, and, uh, is there any, uh, areas of your hand over like any of the joints or over the rest that if you press, um, you, you feel pain? Oh, no. Okay. And are you able to, to move your wrists or the full range of motion? Yeah, I can move it. Okay. And is there any, so that the next test I'll just ask you to just tap on the, the kind of base of your palm there. With your index finger and middle finger of your left hand. And when you do that, do you feel any burning or tingling? Yeah, I definitely do. Okay, so that would be a positive. To that sign, and you get any, so if you flex both of your wrists, so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other. And if you hold that position, do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling? Yeah, as I do feel it as well there. Okay. Alright, so that was everything I wanted to ask about and check today. Did you have any questions? No, I just wanted to know how I can fix this. Yeah, certainly.

So to help with this, one of the first things that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position, but also depending on if there is inflammation there, and said it might help a little bit, like ibuprofen or things like that, but the majority of the therapy will be an activity activity modification and if symptoms don't improve over",

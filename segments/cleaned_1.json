Ted Talks are made possible through the support of BMW.  Here's Al Gore.  Truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice.  I'm extremely grateful.  I have been blown away by this conference.  I think I want to thank you all for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night.  And I say that sincerely, partly because I need that, yourselves in my position.  I flew an Air Force 2 for 8 years.  Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane.  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me."

Soon after, Tipper and I left the White House, we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville driving ourselves.  I know that sounds like a little thing to you, but I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.  There was no motorcade back there.  You've heard of Phantom Limpane.  This was a rented Ford Taurus.  It was dinnertime.  And we started looking for a place to eat.  We were on I-40.  We got to exit 238.  Leaven, Tennessee.  We got off the exit.  We found a Shoneys restaurant.  Look-os, family, restaurant, chain for those of you who don't know it.  We went in and sat down at the booth and the waiters came over, made a big emotion over Tipper.  She took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear what you were saying.  And she said, yes, that's former vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.  And the man said, he's come down a long way.  There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.  The very next day, continuing a totally true story, I got on a G5 to fly somebody else's to fly to Africa, to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Legos on the topic of energy."

I gave my speech then went back out to the airport to fly back home.  I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night we landed on the Azores islands for refueling.  I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man running across the runway.  And he was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling, call Washington, call Washington.

It's positive.  These are investments that pay for themselves, but they are also very effective in deflecting our path.  Cars and trucks.  I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective.  It's an easy, visible target of concern, and it should be, but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks.  Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world.  So we should address that, but it's part of the puzzle.  Other transportation is efficiency as important as cars and trucks.  Carbon capture and sequestration.  That's what CCS stands for.  It's likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.  Not quite there yet.  Okay.  Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home.  Most of these expenditures are also profitable."

It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.  And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.  There is a carbon calculator.  Participant productions convened with my active involvement, the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator.  You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce and in May this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have click through purchases of offsets.  Next, consider making your business carbon neutral.  Again, some of us have done that and it is not as hard as you think.

It doesn't mean that I am trying to convince you to be a Democrat.  We need Republicans as well.  This ought to be a bipartisan issue and I know that in this group it really is.  Become politically active.  Make our democracy work the way it is supposed to work.  Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions for warming pollution and trading it.  Here is why.  It is out of the world system.  It is not a closed system.

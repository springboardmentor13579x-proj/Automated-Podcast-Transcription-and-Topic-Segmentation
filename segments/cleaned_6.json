Ted Talks are made possible for the support of BMW where ideas are everything.  Here's Craig Ventor.  About to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves.  It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism of homophilous influenza that took a genome project from 13 years down to four months.  We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours.  The rate of reading the genetic code has changed."

        "full_text": "But as we look what's out there, we barely scratch the surface on what is available on this planet.  Most people don't realize it because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the earth's biomass.  Whereas all animals only make up about one, one thousandths of all the biomass.  If you ever make it to the sea and do a swallow or mouthful of seawater, keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses.  Less than 5,000 microbial species had been characterized as of two years ago.  And so we decided to do something about it.  And we started the source for two expedition, where we're, as with great oceanographic expeditions, trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.  We started in Bermuda for a test project then moved up to Halifax, working down the US East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, where in their process now, working our way across the Indian Ocean.  It's very tough duty we're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science."

We've extended this to the air.  We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day.  We filter through some simple apparatuses.

And it told her on 29 million genes.  And we tried to put these into gene families to see if, with these discoveries, are we just discovering new members of known families? Are we discovering new families? And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families.  But every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families.  So with their earliest stages of discovery, about basic genes, components, and life on this planet."

        "full_text": "Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA, is change that's sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap.  Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995, not from Michael Plasma, Jenna Talium.  It has roughly 500 genes.  Homophilus had 1,800 genes.  And we simply asked the question, if one species needs 800 and other 500, is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system? We had the genomes of 13 related organisms.  And we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common.  And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms.  The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite, it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so.  So we think that we can expand or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here, to maybe three to 400 genes from the minimal of 500.  We decided to try the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them."

That was 100% accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology.  You have to say, it was a quite exciting experiment when we just took this synthetic piece of DNA injected in the bacteria.  And all of a sudden, that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria.  This was not the first synthetic virus, a polio virus had been made a year before, but it was only one 10,000s of active, and it took three years to do."

        "full_text": "I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years, and possibly eukaryotic cells, those that we have, are possible within a decade.  So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential, not only for understanding the basis of biology, but for hopefully some environmental and society issues.  For example, from the third organism we sequenced Methanococcus unaceae, it lives in boiling water temperatures.  Its energy source is hydrogen, and all its carbon comes from CO2, it captures back from the environment.  So we know lots of different pathways, thousands of different organisms now, that live off of CO2 and can capture that back.  So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes, we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere, converting that into biopolymers or other products.  We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and reuses the reducing power, to split water, to produce hydrogen and oxygen.  Also, there's numerous pathways that can be engineered, metabolizing methane, and DuPont has a major project program with stat oil and Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products."

Right now, the Sloan Foundation is just funded a multi-institutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area, and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.  These are complex issues, except for the threat by our terrorism, they're very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy, perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through very simple processes.

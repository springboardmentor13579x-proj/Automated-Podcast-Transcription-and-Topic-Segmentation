I'm short the father my daughter's five years old and I noticed just a few days ago that she was walking a little bit funny kind of having a limb when she came back from school and since since then she's been saying that it just hurts too much to put any weight on that leg on the right leg. And since then, I've been like carrying around. It's been very painful for her. So I just wanted to come and check what might be going on. Okay, and so I, and and this, what does this exactly start? Um, so just two days ago. Okay. And did she have any trauma, um, to, to her right hip or her to her right leg, like, um, a fall lower Sorry, I know, not that I know of at least and she hasn't told me anything, but she does do some activity, some sports, but I haven't and it's seen or fallen, you were okay. All right, and has she not been able to walk then? Yeah, so I've been carrying her around for at least like she's missed school too, but I've been carrying around for the last one and a half to two days. As soon as I'd like to ask her to walk, she starts kind of hopping and saying that there's a lot of pain near the top of her leg and by her hips whenever she puts her foot down. So yeah, she's in pain crying. So I kind of have to carry her. Okay. And I was her behavior. I've been recently like her mood and things like that. She's definitely been more just a bit anxious about the pain very scared about putting her foot down and just overall I think also more irritable to crying more bits of the pain so but I get to understand if there's something going on it must be very painful. Okay, and all right, and as she had any fevers or chills, I didn't notice a couple of days ago, she felt a bit warm, but we didn't really measure temperature. Over the last few weeks, she has had, kind of, runny nose and a cough, and I think she might have had a fever last week as well. So, she has been sick recently. Okay, so it sounds actually might have had a cold last week, and it looked like the ready nose and cough go away. Yeah, the ready nose and cough are gone. The fever was gone too, but she did feel a little bit warm yesterday, so I'm not sure about that. Okay, so she's a bit warm now, still. Okay, has she had any headaches? No, no headaches.

And, but this would be more progressive on set, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like",

I'm not weak, but it does definitely like when I picked up the pencil and was my wrist up it did it did a cause some some pain Okay, all right, so Would you mind extending or like straightening out your elbow all the way and then also straightening out your wrist Does that hurt? Stringing out, it doesn't hurt Even with like the wrist Straighten out Yeah, if I completely straight on my wrist then like I just feel a bit of a Soreness, but not as much pain as when I am lifting something with my wrist or just raising my wrist outwards. Okay, okay, how about when you flex your wrist all the way? Um, that hurts a little bit, not nearly as much as when I extend it. Okay, um, those are all the questions I have for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for myself? Yeah, I was just wondering what this might be. Yeah, so um, it sounds like you have something called a tennis elbow or lateral epicondolitis. And it's usually related to some overuse injury, so whether at work or if you play a lot of tennis or some sort of sport that overuse is a certain muscle group, particularly like the forearm extensors. And so basically for this, we suggest a few things. We'll start with like some conservative management like activity modifications, so at work if you're We repetitive movement maybe not do them so much and take frequent breaks you can try some like ibuprofen will refer you to some physiotherapy to help those muscles around that area and if those still do still don't work, we can try some other things like operative management, but we'll come back to that in about 6 to 12 months and once we try all of the other stuff, does that sound okay?",

Ted Talks are made possible through the support of BMW where ideas are everything.  Here's Amy Smith.  Tales of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.  I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest.  It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.  It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet.  The number one cause of death in children under five, which is waterborne diseases, diarrhea, malnutrition.  No, it's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires.  A cute respiratory infection caused by this."

How is it that this can lead to over 2 million deaths every year? Haiti is now 98% deforested.  You'll see scenes like this all over the island.  It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation.  A couple years ago, there was severe flooding led to thousands of deaths that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.  So the rains come, they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.  Now, one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this.  People need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.  It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.  They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.  Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.  And so this is what they do.  You'll find families like this who go out into the forest, find a tree, cut it down, and make charcoal out of it."

About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.  This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.  And the idea was that you could take waste paper, you could compress it and make brackets that could be used for fuel.  But this device was very slow.  So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device.  So you can imagine they were very excited about it.  And they took the brackets back to MIT so that they could test them.  And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.  So it was a little discouraging to the students."

And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away.  And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.  What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level.  You see these all over Haiti as well.  They're small-scale sugar mills.  And the waste product from them, after you extract the juice from the sugar cane, is called bagasse.  It has no other use.  It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.  It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it."

After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln.  And then you end up with this carbonized material here.  However, you can't burn this.

And so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of Maniac.  And in fact, it's grown all over the world, yaka, tapioca, maniac cassava.  It's all the same thing, a very starchy, vegetable.  And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.  So we did this.

And this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.  Kids and women are especially affected by it because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.  So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there.  Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugar cane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us.  What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.  And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.  And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for the fuel."

But one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long.  And the briquettes crumbled a little bit.

We took out the in-strong machine and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it.  And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there.  And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only, well, actually it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.  So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be.  In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.  There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those."

And one of the things that I think is also interesting is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.  And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal.  And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.  That's remarkable.  But up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.  But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel."

This is corncobbs turned into charcoal.  And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form bricette.  It comes ready made.  And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is so easy.  Compared to the sugar cane charcoal, where we actually have to teach people how to form it into bricats.  And you have the extra step of cooking the binder.  This comes pre-briceted.

And they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own.  It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics or environment and economics.  So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting.

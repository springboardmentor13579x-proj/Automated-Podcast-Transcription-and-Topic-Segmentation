        "summary": "My\n own complete happiness, and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who\n first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our\n lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week\n between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own\n keen nature. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my\n wooing, and with the dark incidence of the study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen\n desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.",
